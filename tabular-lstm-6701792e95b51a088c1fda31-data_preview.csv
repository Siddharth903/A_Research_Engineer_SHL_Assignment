4,"Perfect, perfect, perfect","I like that company because they clearly care about their products and customers. They don't sell the latest &#34;fad&#34; &#34;diet pills&#34; or what have you, they sell real biomolecules that your body will really use as labeled. They really go to great lengths to explain the science behind their nutritional supplements.<br /><br />And of course the Melatonin helps me sleep wonderfully :) Sometimes I also take a Benadryl if I'm really having trouble sleeping. That combination really puts me out all night.<br /><br />Oh I think the gelatin capsule gives me acid reflux :/ But I noticed that opening the capsule and dumping the powder under my tongue prevents it from happening.",B07CS691CZ,AEJBU2VDOM5R7LKBVMR6XPKKU2DA,2017-04-05 18:53:21.000

4,Perfect,"One n' Only is the best!  When I began to have health issues in 2006 I became diligent about seeking quality vitamin supplements, along with changing my diet drastically.  Unfortunately, I found that most quality supplements require dosages of multiple tablets, multiple times per day. One day in 2007 as I shopped at a health food store, I happened upon the One n' Only supplements and decided to try it since it contained most of the vitamins, minerals, amino acids, and herbs I sought.  I have not used another multi-vitamin since.  My skin and hair never looked better.  My daughter, who is 19, takes One n' Only and notices a difference in her skin and hair as well.",B07SWJ3QJQ,AFXSOWTMZOL5IBQVTQP3DCQSUMXQ,2018-05-24 18:29:46.820

5,Five Stars,I like the product however 10 servings! The product is not that good that I would be willing to pay $20 for 10 servings! I think this is a total scam that you only get 10 servings. I order hundreds of supplements each year and the lowest I have ever seen in a bottle is 20 days. This shows that this company is only concerned with the money. This does not say trial..<br /><br />I have not seen much with the product.. I recommend just going straight to the source and buying just these supplements Phosphatidylserine the main ingredient for focus and then get some yerba mate for energy.,B06XXW2FKQ,AG2XPDP7T3TENW5XEUAMFT6AC3DQ,2015-03-25 11:59:59.000
5,Great!,"Scale works, app is pretty good, but the main reason I bought this is for the body fat % which is nowhere near accurate. I’m a guy in my early 20s and my BF % is between 12-15% and the scale consistently reads 25+%. My dad had the same issue of the BF% being ridiculously higher than what it should be.<br /><br />*** Edit - the 1byone team reached out to me and they have A+ customer service.",B00028OOZC,AFHOGQBUKR6KFG7BNEDMZYHKKGYA,2017-10-19 14:59:36.848

4,Multivitamin,"I started taking these in part because I had read that the high levels of antioxidants might lead to some reduction in cholesterol without the side effects of cholesterol medication. I took them at the recommended dosage for several months and my last lab work did show a slight reduction in  cholesterol. I am a 67 year old guy. It took a while to notice, because it came on very slowly but my libido was beginning to decline to the point that my sexual desire was pretty low. I got to thinking and I realized that the loss in libido started some time after I starrted these. I stopped taking these and my libido is returning to its normal level. I noticed the improvement began about 3 days after I stopped taking them.<br /><br />If you should take these pay attention and make a mental note if your libido begins to decline. It takes weeks to notice it. Otherwise, I did not notice any change in my health either good or bad with taking these.",B006FQC6P0,AEQGDJVN44O7EDNCWLO2L2JFTVOQ,2023-04-11 21:30:25.668

They’re easy to take, no pills to try to get kids to swallow and no messy liquids that can spill or stain. Plus unlike gummies they aren’t coated in sugar or filled with gelatin. They’re vegan so suitable for most diets and restrictions. And they’re D3 which is absorbed by the body better than D2.",B00F7OZJOQ,AFLLBHTEGIBMU5ESX54KABMRH5AA,2019-05-09 19:31:23.037

They love to see how many steps they take in a day and it is helping them with time.",B07DP9SJQ8,AHLMWNQBSMO43DJ2NBCSJSE7PSJQ,2015-07-30 15:23:45

3,Dissolve Biotin,"Got this watch for my 9 year old who wanted a step tracking watch like his big sister. Works great. A little annoying to unplug to recharge and wish the bands were easier for him to undo (he also has small wrists.) Overall, very pleased. Holds a charge for days (and he's a pretty active kid.)",B07VHGX6C7,AF4RCVHGIBLQ22Y6TLGTFR76SSHQ,2019-02-17 02:16:56.082
4,ecstatic,"I was taking these to help fight a candida overgrowth I have and they worked fantastic. I haven't felt that great in a long time.

4,Quick and Easy to Use,"I have been anemic for some time, largely due to low levels of B-12 and folate. I tried several other supplement products, most ones in pill form, but these other products were difficult to digest and therefore really irritated my stomach. After regularly taking this product for just two weeks, I noticed a significant improvement in my energy levels without being nauseated or experiencing stomach discomfort. I would highly recommend this product for people with sensitive stomachs, as well as for people who are tired of being tired. It has successfully aided in improving my cell levels.",B01A90FMHQ,AEQLFOUY2FIB5BAFOXE4AIXCRJDQ,2016-11-22 18:54:52.000

2,Pills Stuck Together,Used this brand for years after a recommendation from a pharmacist.  Used to buy the selection for adults but that seems to have disappeared about the time of the quarantine.  I switched to seniors which has almost item per item the same and so are the dosages of the item.  Takes a long time to get!  Which is why it is 4 stars and not 5.,B002VLZ8C6,AGTZ7WSZG2JFLQKBNC2JATYMMZIA,2017-10-24 22:41:17.718
4,Prefer brighter display,"There are times when I need a bit of help with concentration and mental focus. These capsules certainly help. I've bought these a number of times. I don't use these everyday, just when I feel I need it. So I find this a reasonably affordable compared to  some mental boosters that contain a lot of other substances (as well as a smaller amount of alpha-GPC) but only last for a few weeks at the most, and cost the same as this or much more.",B0096U3VD8,AEOIVD7X4EPG3JLJ7FGMHDZVUS2Q,2020-06-21 23:37:34.341

5,Not worth it,"I've loved these! I'm a vegetarian, so I'm always low on B12, D3, & Iron. This supplement has higher amounts of all of these, which has helped me tremendously!

4,This is not vegetarian,The bands are nice quality and identical to the original Fitbit band. I ordered the fuschia and black colors. The fuschia is a lot lighter than pictured. it is more of a medium pink color making it not as versatile to wear as a darker color.<br /><br />Revising my review 1-1/2 months later. Black band broke and the second band will not attach to fitbit. Waste of money.,B01B28ONC4,AETDZP6AO6D7UUVOCMDYNGOLMPEQ,2020-01-23 21:53:43.108
2,So far so Good,"This product is priced very reasonably through Amazon's subscribe & save, compared to health store prices, and it ships quickly on a single qty. order. The bottle comes sealed to prevent leaks & to prevent tampering as well as being shipped in a bubble-wrap envelope for single qty. orders.<br /> I think the Vegan Blackberry is Barlean's best tasting & highest ALA, omega3,6,9 content that they offer in their flavored organic oils. I have added it to my subscribe & save for the discount & so that I can automatically get it every 2nd Tues. of the month. Quite honestly, one of the best services Amazon could offer.<br /> Lastly, the benefits of taking 2 tablespoons daily has been an improved mood, better mental focus and healthier skin, nails, & hair.",B07SYNTL34,AEADUQ24AIJ667GUUHEWA2XU7KZA,2010-09-02 22:24:53

1,Help with my psoriasis but not only that....,I just ordered and am very upset I was told by a nurse in my support that Bariatric Choice is not a Bariatric Vitamin company. I am very upset please I need positive feedback. I have to say I emailed Bariatric choice concerned and they got backto me within an hour saying they area Bariatric Vitamin company an usually what Gastric Sleeve and Gastric Bypass patients have heard is that Iron can not be taken with Calcium<br />because Iron will not allow the calcium to be absorbed. Bariatric Choice informed me that that is true in some cases But Bariatric All In One is specially formulated to allow the calcium to be absorbed. So I am very happy to say I am now a Bariatric Choice customer and happy,B006FQC6P0,AH44YVNM7ZR44WPOUARWSEA62O5A,2019-05-24 12:34:08.552

3,Great for my lipgloss business,"1.  I have the A360 and the lame Polar wrist strap broke (that little white plastic thing fell out) and really started to stink and thus it was time to look for a replacement.  Since the Polar strap is really lame and expensive, it was a no brainer NOT  to get another one from Polar and thus I decided to take a risk on this third party strap.  The following are some bottomline notes:<br />  a:  Size:  one size and it does tend on the larger side of things.  I a man, 5ft 8in, medium build and this strap fits snug, but I have to go near the end of the strap to do so... which leaves a lot of strap at the other end... which I cut off.  I would think that for many women, this may be too big (of course depending on build).<br />  b:  Does this thing actually work?  At first, I thought this was a dud because the inside ""housing"" didn't have the rigid component that the original Polar strap has.  Furthermore, when I put my A360 insight, the thing popped out when I put the strap on and I was about to return it.  Instructions?  Don't even bother due to the low quality of instructions and basically everyone who is buying this already owns the A360/370 and thus knows how to put it in.  However, all I have to say is, really look at the unit in the strap, ensure that it is completely embedded in the strap and it will definitely work / stay in place.  I can't explain it any better;  it definitely does work, the price is right, good colors;  just work with the unit and you'll be happy with it.",B01A90FMHQ,AFPYQV3F2LGAD23AMC7QSCEQ5VOQ,2018-12-08 16:36:49.338

When you kill mold in the body it makes you constipated. I find that taking a couple capsules of oxy-poweder, which is “ozonated magnesium”, with dinner each night relieves this completely and makes sure my body is able to continue eliminating the toxins created my the dying mold/yeast/candida.

I usually take two a day and that keeps cramps at bay nine 99% of the time .<br /><br />I had used Swanson products for better than a decade and always find them to be top quality . At purchase many of them through Amazon because I can get them a lot quicker than I would ordering from Swanson . Swanson also has another product that I've used in conjunction with one celery seed to stop a gout attack .,B00028OOZC,AHQVWPU3IL6LT4BO5CMVN6VNVZGQ,2017-02-12 12:42:20.000

2,so far i have seen a little bit of skin ...,"Right out the box it didn't work. I just went to the doctor the morning I received this product. This scale was 16lbs off from the doctor. I would move it to another spot in the house and it would be even more off. I decided to weight my self in the morning to see where I was next to a scale from my neighbors that we verified worked and was within a respectable range. Still, about a 15-20lbs difference every time I stepped on. I never got the same reading twice. I know a lot effects weight but to be constantly off by that much, well that doesn't help when it comes to weight loss since I would never know what was the correct reading. A couple pounds during weight loss really does count, lol, in helping you see progress. I even went out and bought new batteries, waste of money as there was no change. I would suggest spending about $10 more for something better. I thought I would give this guy a chance, but man it wasn't worth the hassle. Amazon was good about the return though.",B00NP759OM,AHUMBIIBFOLNTBJJASBEZCVHMAZA,2017-03-29 16:19:59.000

4,works fine but wish it had harder,"I wish I could pinpoint of the effects of choline bitartrate but since it's part of a nootropic (cognitive enhancing) stack, it's almost impossible to parse out its effect. However, I can comment on the ease of using a powder vs. a capsule. I've found (after purchasing a milligram scale) that most capsulized supplements can add up to 50% additional in filler. So, a capsule containing 500 mg of the active substance may have 750 mg of powder which will usually include various fillers to make the automated filling process work efficiently. I am glad that BulkSupplements has a large selection of powders and I will replacing several more of my capsulated supplements once they run out.<br /><br />For those that may be interested, my basic nootropic stack consists of<br />Choline bitartrate 750 mg<br />Piracetam 1.5 grams<br />Noopept 25 mg<br />L-Taurine 1.3 grams<br />Acetyl L-Carnitine 1000 mg (will be replacing the capsules with the BS ALCAR powder once the capsules are finished)<br /><br />The effect of all these items is to enhance cognition, memory and recall. It works in a subtle manner which means that the focus is there when needed but is not a constant effect like getting high or something that hits you strongly. Choline helps to increase the neurotransmitter acetylcholine in the brain. Nootropics like piracetam seem to make the brain consume more acetylcholine, hence the need to supplement it in a nootropic stack.",B07RMX8QCR,AFCV6T4CVTHCQJU6JOVY3EDX5IGA,2011-07-16 16:34:11.000
4,Delicious and healthy,The scale was delivered with a thud. I feared it would be broken. I quickly opened the box and to my amazement everything was OK. The only thing missing was the battery.  I thought there should have been a starter set included.  I retrieved a couple of batteries from my utility draw and put them in the machine. After placing the scale in our bathroom e tried it out. It worked perfectly and looks good in the room.  The scale was just what we wanted. The only problem was the delivery person who didn’t ring the doorbell but did drop the package. Lucky for him the scale hadn’t broken.,B01M111LZ2,AET7ZXCV4GI32O7OR2HKKP4MXHNA,2017-08-22 02:45:34.830

4,I like Now products especially the coconut oil,"This scale is not accurate at all! Many reviews say it is.  Trust me, it’s way off.  For example , step on 5 lbs heavier, step off and on again 5lbs lighter. You can do this several times and weight will be different. If you are on a weight loss journey this will only discourage you, as you won’t know really be able to measure your progress",B075GCYM6Q,AEPQYWX4VHQPPTDIXNO3JKUXSTUA,2013-10-20 02:04:50.000
5,Does not work.,"I needed a replacement for an older fitness band that I lost, due to the band detaching from the unit. I wanted a fitness tracker that used the same app (Very Fit Pro), and came with an extra band. I wanted one band to be pink or light color so that it wouldn't stand out when I wear dressier clothing. I also wanted a dark color band so that I wouldn't get stains (common in the reviews for pink bands). I wear the purple band normally and have switched to the pink band for when I dress up. The pink is a  light peachy pink that doesn't stand out against my skin (as much as the purple would). I can even layer a few bracelets near it, which makes it virtually disappear.<br />Also with two bands, the time it takes for the band to loosen (where you detach it to charge it) will be longer. &lt;&lt;&lt;That is the reason I lost my other fitness band.",B017DT4HM2,AEXMYGDBVTZHVJLJ4SJ7P3PBN4UQ,2022-04-24 14:47:22.576

4,Excellent product!,"I have long suspected that I was magnesium deficient, due to chronic muscle spasms and cramping issues. I tried several types of magnesium that did not give me relief...and then I tried Magnesium Glycinate. This product worked almost immediately. The relief it gave me was way more than I ever expected. Not only has it eliminated cramping, it has enhanced my workout recovery,  helped alleviate joint pain and in general has a very relaxing effect on me (without impacting my workout intensity).<br />  I began using magnesium glycinate in capsule form, which was an easy way to establish my tolerance. I quickly learned that I respond better to small dosages throughout the day. The capsule form can be quite expensive, so I inevitably switched over to the powder. I mix the powder with my water and protein shakes and end up consuming a total of 1-1.5 tspn. daily. The taste was rough at first, but I quickly got used to it.<br />  The overall effect that magnesium supplementation has had on me is fascinating, to say the least. It has prompted me to experiment with other liquid and transdermal products. These also seem to work and I will incorporate them into my routine from time to time, but the powder will remain the staple of my supplementation. Thanks for an awesome and inexpensive product.",B0002C9RHS,AHGRAOQKHFE4A3EILJRQDC6ZBTQQ,2016-02-05 23:28:11.000

3,difficult taste,I'm excited about this product. It really works. I’ve been using this product for about a month now and I do see a slight increase in my height. And getting my basketball 🏀 in better shape. So here's the scoop. I an average height but who doesn't want to be taller so I ordered these. This stuff seems to be working! How is it working for me.. I pair this with a healthy diet for consistent results. I think I've gained about 1/4 inch so far. The bummer is I wish I'd have bought these when I was a kid. I will continue to take this product and will keep you updated. So far so GREAT,B002VLZ8C6,AGNWQTBC5GVA5LET5JB44RWU3VXQ,2017-06-05 15:52:17.000

4,Five Stars,"I could not be happier with this product. Fast shipping and an easy transaction. Tastes just like nasty tasting magnesium should taste. I love that this is instantly in my belly and i do not have to wait for dissolving pills and such. I felt a sense of calm after the first use. The dosage i am taking is 1000 mg a day. After three days my veins are no longer bulging out of the top of my hands. I am very satisfied. The packaging is wonderful. Easy to stash in the fridge and easy to scoop out of too. I just scoop out a 1/4 tsp. and mix in a shot glass of water and shoot it down. It really does taste pretty gross but the benefits far outweigh my whining about the taste. I love this and now have ordered some Potassium. i cannot wait to try it. I am overall very satisfied with this entire transaction, product and any other aspects of this purchase.

I originally was using magnesium citrate powder but discovered this wasn't the best form of magnesium to use. So after after researching and deciding that magnesium glycinate would be better I started looking for some. It's not the easiest form of magnesium powder to find especially at an affordable price. This was a good price and the product comes in a really easy to use package. I like that I don't have more plastic bottles around that I have to discard. This works well with the re-mineralize recipe I use for making the toothpaste. Over all I'm super satisfied with it.

4,Very good but not quite great.,"Just for the record, I'm in my late 40's, and I'm a type 2 diabetic. I have to take medications for my diabetes, thyroid and menopause and 3 out of the 4 medications can cause drowsiness. Also my diabetes, my thyroid and being menopausal also cause fatigue so I absolutely HAVE to have something to perk me up some days or I'd never get out of bed sometimes.<br /><br />I used to take Ginseng Energy Now and I still like those but for my sometimes giant-economy-sized fatigue, I needed something more so I tried these and they work for those times when I need more of a boost than I can get from the Ginseng version of these pills.<br /><br />I take one of these pills in the morning with a tab of caffeine - it's just a store brand that is 200mg caffeine. Note that I don't drink coffee and normally I drink green tea which doesn't have a lot of caffeine so other people might not need the caffeine.<br /><br />I found after taking the Energy Now/caffeine combo that I would frequently forget to eat - I'd look at the clock and see it was already 2:00pm (I take the combo at about 6:00am). Too bizarre! I've bought appetite suppressants that didn't work as well (and were much more expensive). I don't know why they seem to suppress my appetite - maybe it's because I have so much energy that I'm busier or maybe it's because I'm older and have menopause? I'm not sure. I only know that I have much more control over my hormonal hunger (ie PMS or Menopause) than I used to. I'm not saying they'll work that way for everyone but they do for me (so far).<br /><br />I haven't taken this combo for long  and I don't take them every day but on the days I need them, I wouldn't want to be without them.<br /><br />Generally I only take one Ultra Energy Now pill + 1 caffeine tab at a time but I have taken 2 Ultra Energy Now pills along with the caffeine and I still didn't get the jitters or have any trouble sleeping although I have to say, I've never taken either after 3:00pm.<br /><br />These are definitely a must have for me and I will almost certainly be ordering them again.<br /><br />One last thing: The pills are rather large so if you have trouble with pill swallowing then these might not be the solution for you.<br /><br />Note that I an in NO WAY affiliated with either the vendor or the maker of these. I am only a buyer/consumer.",B071KCSD54,AEPXUSK434G6BWNV32V7WQ6XQ67Q,2020-09-09 00:26:27.718

5,Five Stars,These were a wonderful vitamin for my toddler to make sure that she was getting her Vitamin D. From what I could tell hey had no taste at all and she gladly took it in her cup with water or milk. This was such an easy way to make sure she was getting all her d vitamin during the winter when we were stuck inside from the snow. My only complaint was the bottle leaked all the time but we live at a very high elevation so my guess was it was more of my issue and less of a company wide issue :),B013TC28EQ,AGDPVL7CY7764K7LT5EKBPSKQ4KQ,2019-03-14 10:49:47.350

The alarms work, but they are very gentle vibrations so they don't wake me from sleep. Good if you use them to take meds on time though... The app is good and easy to use.

5,I really love it :),"The last time I saw my doctor she urge me to take vitamin d. I actually took this bottle in for her to provide her expertise and she said this is perfect. Especially since it is in a liquid form, which makes it easier to absorb so that it actually gets into my system a lot faster than if I was taken it in a form of a pill. Although I haven't been taken this bottle of vitamin d3 for a long period of time, I am very happy with it. However I did notice my teeth aren't a sensitive as they were prior to taking this vitamin d3 supplement. I love the taste and the convenience of being able to use a dropper to take the vitamins (especially when I am on the go) it's a huge help. I definitely will be ordering more!",B000TDE2W0,AGZYZPCSS7YU3J7UJGLHPH265Z2A,2018-02-28 07:08:46.926
5,great for children who can't swallow pills,"This is super moisturizing cream, that is absorbed quickly and doesn't irritate my sensitive skin. I use it as a general moisturizer for my hands and face. It leaves my skin feeling really soft and healthy looking. The effects seem to last for quite a while and the longer you use it the better the results, I have found.<br /><br />I first came across this cream when looking for something to cure my dad's eczema on his hands. The tips of his fingers had long deep splits in them and were incredibly painful for him. I happened across someone who advised using this propolis cream in conjunction with the Forever Living Aloe Vera juice [[ASIN:B00137JS3O Forever Aloe Vera Gel, 33.8 oz]]. You drink an 'egg cup' (about 2 tablespoons) twice a day and rub on the propolis cream. This cleared up my dad's eczema within a few days. Way more effective than the doctor's steroid creams. Later on, when his eczema came back, we tried just the cream on its own. It did work - but not as quickly or as effectively as doing the drink and the cream together. In the past we have also tried other brands of aloe vera cream and drinks - but they have not been as effective - so on this product I am brand loyal. After a couple of rounds of this, my dad's eczema disappeared completely and has never returned. Many years later, he experienced very dry skin on the palms of his hands as a side effect to taking some medication. The skin was literally peeling off in big sections. Once again, the doctor prescribed steroid cream that had no effect. He went back to the propolis cream and aloe vera drink and again within a few days his condition cleared up.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this cream generally and in combination with the Forever Living aloe vera  drink for anyone with eczema or other skin conditions.",B07RQBH9YD,AFZSBFUKSSZY5OHHLIOVIF5BXJKA,2017-09-28 11:34:19.246

(Major reason we like Nordic brand was also because Nordic omega 3 does not give us the fishy taste afterwards). They tasted just like ""smoothies"" as advertised !!! Nobody would think this is Omega 3. And they are vegan ... All natural fruit flavor, non-GMO, and gluten free !!!!!

5,Incredible Value vs competitors!,"Very easy set up and requires 4 AA batteries.  The unit can be cleared out at any time to allow up to 90 readings for each person.  Small enough to carry around in my purse if need arose.  Did not come with adapter, however, if you need one, they are available.  I did notice the cuff has more adjustment leeway than the more expensive one I have had for years making it easier to adjust to my arm size which is smaller.  The readings are in large print to be easily viewed, but the date and year are in small print, consequently if one has a problem seeing, this could be a problem.

5,Love it,"[[VIDEOID:26c201204afe247d1b0a51b0caba25eb]] I thought the reviews were very misleading. I don't think I would have made the purchase of I knew. I probably won't be ordering again. You have to take 4 of these horse pills a day. That's about $2 a day. The back says you should take them at different meal times and for me I barely remember once. The capsule is extremely thick, to the point I don't want to try ingesting them. They open very easily but the powder is tough on the stomach and smells/taste rough. The ingredients seem amazing but at that price I want more convienence.",B0030GZWHW,AGUYQTCS5YWWLNQKTHPYJPP3ILSQ,2018-11-04 03:02:38.075

2,Five Stars,"The pills are a great value, they supply all the needed B vitamins with added minerals. My only complaint is that the pills are very large and are not coated, making them hard for me to swallow. Currently, I dissolve them in applesauce which takes care of it.however, I'm searching for this brand in a gelcap or coated form. I'm still looking so if anyone else has found please let me know.!  This IS a great product as long as you can swallow the pills...Thanks !",B07SYNTL34,AEGO3ICQIGAAGKYKORDKHAN5YNIQ,2017-09-16 00:02:46.833

4,easy to read,"I'm on my fourth bottle of Tropical Oasis Men's Premium Liquid Multivitamins and I can state that the results are far and away much better than pills or gummies.  I feel better, have more energy, and definitely notice when I miss a dose.<br />On the downside, my first bottle contained a sunny yellow liquid that smelled and tasted fairly pleasant.  The three subsequent bottles all contained a more brownish liquid with a smell and taste that varied from bottle to bottle, with the third bottle being a dark brown color and a somewhat foul aroma.  None have given me any ill effects; however, the inconsistency in the product is a bit troubling.",B002VLZ8DU,AG6QHRK3TK3LUSONEXFXGDNGESCA,2014-06-15 22:07:15.000

4,Great product,"This watch says that it has blood oxygen monitoring.  There is no such read out.  The blood pressure and pulse was remarkably accurate the four times I checked with a professional cuff.  The GPS run tracker was very inaccurate.  I think it is due to a needed filter in the software.  Finally, the step counter was very far off.  I would guess about 30% low on a two mile walk.  I got zero sleep time last night according to the sleep monitor.  I know I got at least 6 hours of sleep.",B017DT4HM2,AHG5JGRTI5QMUXI6UCHNRS3RCZ3A,2017-06-02 14:07:54.000

3,The quality was excellent. I would highly recommend it to others,"While it says it works for a Charge 2, it doesn't.

4,Trustworthy and expertly sourced!,"My regular brand of glucose tabs were out of stock so tried these. The flavors are really good - better than my other brand, but the potency didn't seem quite the same as my other brand. Ended up needing 2-3 tabs to get sugar up vs just 1-2 of my other brand. These tabs were also super powdery - that is something I found very annoying as I would get powder all over when getting the tabs out of the container (note to new users - don't turn the bottle over to get your glucose tabs out - you'll have a mess on your hands and all over everything else around you)! That said, they did their job once I got the dose down and I thought all the flavors were delicious.  Would buy again if I can't get my other brand.",B00XJU61E2,AF2GQ7TAXHHN3ILWQLNBSNECQWOQ,2016-02-05 23:28:11.000

I started to take B-12 in the form of shots from my doctor, and when they ended I was supposed to keep taking the vitamin form.

4,They are very firm.,"I like that company because they clearly care about their products and customers. They don't sell the latest &#34;fad&#34; &#34;diet pills&#34; or what have you, they sell real biomolecules that your body will really use as labeled. They really go to great lengths to explain the science behind their nutritional supplements.<br /><br />And of course the Melatonin helps me sleep wonderfully :) Sometimes I also take a Benadryl if I'm really having trouble sleeping. That combination really puts me out all night.<br /><br />Oh I think the gelatin capsule gives me acid reflux :/ But I noticed that opening the capsule and dumping the powder under my tongue prevents it from happening.",B01F3N8NRK,AF4GJ27M36UK2YTMNS3SWAIR3CBQ,2017-04-20 21:54:51.000

2,Ordered twice!!,"This is a great, compact blood pressure machine.  The machine itself is very easy to use.

I saw no difference in my condition while taking these supplements. The mysterious name probably should have been a clue... I've read that a lot of people swear by these, but maybe they just don't work for me. However, I've responded to other treatments, such as capryllic acid and some parasite cleanse, so I would suggest trying something else first before trying this.",B00X45QGQK,AEDPNE6KYAECUPNU2FBQXVRCYHUQ,2014-12-23 19:26:39.000

4,Arrived on time.,"I really try to like these but had to stop taking them in my early pregnancy because they’d get stuck in my throat and make me vomit because my body couldn’t get it down. That happened often, not just once or twice. I have no problem taking pills but it made me buy gummy vitamins for fear of not getting them in. Here I am a few months later giving it another try, and this bottle smells putrid of fish. It once again is getting stuck in my throat and struggling to get it down. They seem coated well and not too thick so it’s confusing. Now I’m haunted with fish burps too after it sits in your throat. This is just disgusting. I did take this the other day without eating first and I felt very sick the rest of the day. I’m now in my third trimester and just cannot get behind these.",B073Z8DYFB,AFRIEMP5ROBA6SZVJAJU2GQ3KVAQ,2018-05-05 04:47:52.905

4,Worth It,"Like many others before me, the one I received doesn't beep.  Either they've got a very lax QC department, or they're putting all the returned thermometers back on the shelf for sale.  So when I put it in my mouth, I have no idea when it's ready.  I have my wife watch the 'F' until it stops flashing.  With about 20 tests between us, the highest temp we've seen is 97.7, which I seriously doubt.  I know it goes higher, because I saw it up around 105 when I was washing it.<br /><br />I tried calling the customer support number that iProven posted under most of the negative comments, but it's not a valid phone number  (855700166) - only 9 digits.<br /><br />Edit:  Well, this is my own fault.  I saw the number of review and the high average and went with that.  My bad.  Upon a deeper look, the recent reviews are not all that kind, and if you check fakespot.com, they give the review quality of this product an 'F' grade.<br />[...]",B07H47Y122,AGYRVQI3BA4LAJL2YQGLI3ZYPIQQ,2016-02-21 02:52:53.000

3,Gross. Just gross.,"When I originally ordered these vitamins, I honestly thought I would never switch from my usual brand. I buy a gummy vitamin that comes in similar selections, and they taste so much better than the usual gummy vitamins I am stuck selecting between. (I usually only take the gummy vitamins because I don't stomach the pills well.) When I tried these, however, they not only tasted better but also were very fresh tasting! When you bit into these, there is no rip or pulling that your teeth have to do, it just cuts through so easily! FYI: they also don't stick to your teeth at all. Usually, I have to pick some of the vitamins out of my mouth. I would highly recommend these!",B006FQC6P0,AGDRPNTON2MCEYVWCK3KUFWGMKUA,2021-03-27 09:10:02.215
4,Amazing value for coconut oil,Have purchased several times and this formula is part of a regime for my dry eye condition.

I've having trouble with them this time around, have to partially chew them and they still won't dissolve. Expiration date is 07/2020, so I'm thinking this particular lot may be the issue.

4,The vitamin c soft-gel tablets works the best,"I loooove these vitamins. I’ve never purchased a vitamin before that I was prepared to purchase over and over again like I have begun doing. It does sadden me tho that the price went. The low price was definitely a part of the appeal! It’s made me have to choose between which one (s) I will purchase. I’ve purchased the multi, the healthy bone, and the biotin. I absolutely ADORE ALL of them.

The quality held up the whole 5 years and it still seems just as high quality. I would really recommend this product and it's perfect for running. Of course because it's a pouch, you can't touch your screen through it, but if you don't mind not being able to change your music, then it works great.

5,Great product,My husband and I have been using this for a month and he has an iPhone and I have an Android. The app crashes on both of our phones and it also would not let you select anything on the app before it started crashing. They want to charge $150 plus a subscription but the app is so garbage! How disappointing. I'm trying to see if I can return this since it is useless now. Ugh.,B078SKP5DX,AGFF32LF6XVGHLUOOQALNXPCFDJQ,2020-08-26 12:23:19.528

4,A large improvement over the provided band on the Garmin Approach S60 golf watch,"I use this to help combat styes and chalazions. We heard that flaxseed oil (omega-3 source) can help prevent them. My daughter had several styes and a chalazion removed at age 4 and then had an active chalazion when we started her on this oil. Paired with warm compresses daily, the chalazion went away (it was hanging around for a long time). I go through a bottle a month so it is expensive but far less than cost of surgery. And we swear this oil helped heal the active chalazion. As an alternative, we sometimes mix organic flaxseed oil with kefir for the omega-3 blast.",B00068SETK,AHCUNMSGPEAPOTK665PGH5HSE23Q,2021-02-19 13:46:35.273

4,Different,"I had psoriasis (diagnosed by a dermatologist) on my right arm extending from the wrist to the elbow for OVER 10 YEARS!  I tried the doctor-prescribed steroids which only temporarily cleared it up.  Found this product on Amazon while searching for any/all topical vitamin creams.  Read reviews & tried it in 7/15.  This cream successfully cleared up the patch of psoriasis in two months and it has NOT returned since.  I used only a small amount of the cream on the arm as the cream goes a long way.  Now I just put the cream on the arm 2x/week.  Also got a blood test for Vitamin D & discovered my level was far too low at 18 so I took Vitamin D in pill form at 5,000 IU 2x/day for over a year to bring levels back up to 58.  Then I read the book titled &#34;Healing Psoriasis&#34; by Pagano, D.C.  Had food allergy testing done (cost for this blood test was $200) & eliminated all allergens from my diet.",B002BQ3EHM,AHMIAUMN3SB4KDBMCLMBAE7ZE6IA,2016-03-09 02:03:34.000

3,Mental disturbances,"I am not sure about all the &#34;additional&#34; benefits such as improved mood or sexual drive, but the product is great for hair. I have used other brand's He Shou Wu in pill form and didn't really notice anything. I take a couple teaspoons of this a day and I have really noticed a difference in my hair. I'm 32, never really had grey hair but my hair is thinning slowly and it had gone from darker brown to that dishwater blonde light-brown color. This has made my hair go back to the darker brown. My girlfriend asked if I dyed my hair, saying it looked darker. It is also more &#34;lively&#34; and full. It sticks up more and poofs out like it did 10 years ago. I don't know if it will make really grey hair brown or black again, but it definitely made my hair darker. I think I may have my dad start taking it as an experiment to see how effective it is on really grey hair. It is kind of expensive and I'm sure I'm overdosing, but I like it.",B07VHGX6C7,AE6SNJVDYMOCRNGQXLDEAMYIZNEQ,2020-07-28 06:32:31.938

Not sure about all the ingredients, I mean if they are considered healthy or not, but I have used this product on and off for about 10 years for my psoriasis and it makes a difference. However, it does not miraculously remove it from my skin in a couple of weeks but It definitely provides a better option than cortisone creams.

4,Favorite Vitamin D3 Cream so far!,"I do not in any way mean to discredit the seller or the maker of this product, there are other reviews on here that indicate that people had better experiences all around and I don't doubt that at all.  My wife & I noticed that on Amazon it says 1/2 to 1 teaspoon serving size, but on the product it says 1 to 2 teaspoons serving size, I would stick with the first - just note this.  I suffer from severe psoriasis it started 23 years ago and has become much worse over time.  I ditched my injections over a year ago with Covid fears and suppressing my natural immune system and have tried unsuccessfully to control it through diet and whatnot so I found myself trying out this product in hopes of any relief, so today the product arrived on time : )  I immediately got started and took a glass of warm water and dissolved 2 teaspoons of powder into water. First sip was extremely unpleasant,  I knew right there I would never be able to drink it, so I grabbed a second glass added honey and sugar to water and added maybe 25 percent of original glass into now deluded batch and swigged it down.  I felt like I swallowed gasoline, but managed to do this one more time adding another 1/4 of original glass to a new sweetened glass of water. Very very horrible I knew I could do another, this would be equivalent to 1 teaspoon down in two glasses of water. Then I emptied a gel pill I had and filled it with the powder and swallowed it down and called it good.  About an hour later I puked my guts out, was not from lingering taste it just forced it's way back up, also noticed I had a weird headache on half my brain not as painful as a regular headache, but more sickening like I felt poisoned like a rat or something?  The sick feeling in my stomach lasted from 2:00 - 7:00 but the gross headache lasted until about 8:30 or so but still feels strange dizzy kind of feeling.  If you can believe it my wife stills wants to keep it for herself,  but I am advising her to take no more than 1/16 or less of a teaspoon at a time.  I know some people actually take notes of some things in tinctures meaning cut it 100 times and cut it again - this stuff is strong and I believe small amounts should have results, but for me I am not taking any more for the rest of my life : )  I hope you have better luck Lord knows we all need it.",B07BLJDW4J,AFF7SZRLSXNREQLGYY4QXWTUXZ4A,2016-08-26 14:14:38.000

4,Love,"It's been frustrating finding a high quality vegan multivitamin.  Finding one that really gives me what I'm missing instead of just giving me everything and hoping my needs are covered. OptiVego really did their research.<br /><br />I believe in balance and that the way to a healthy body is to meet your macro nutrients. Eating vegan means I sometimes miss out on essential vitamins. I'm happy that OptiVego is so focused on balance. There is so much scientific information on their website but it is presented in a very easy to understand way. I've gained complete confidence in these vitamins, knowing I will get what my body needs.<br /><br />When they first arrived, I felt like having to take them twice a day was a down side, but the capsules are so small that it was just a matter of adding it into my routine. The more I think about it, taking them more than once a day means my body is continually receiving the nutrients it needs to consistently function well, instead of having highs and lows.<br /><br />I'm very happy with my purchase, and with the peace of mind I get knowing my body is well taken care of.",B07HLB1JXX,AHWZZY3A5V2YNKPFRW4BPQQHJW2Q,2021-05-23 02:06:34.718

I always value honest, and to me, there is not a chance that this product would honestly receive so many great reviews. I don't think the product is terrible, maybe a little expensive for how much you get from it, but I only noticed a slight, if any, increase in concentration. An energy shot could do the same.

I add it to a iced chai each morning and make sure I do not have it after 2pm, as I do not want to be up all night.I may have also noticed impact to my libido, but it may be too early to say for sure. I am excited to gain more benefits the longer I use it. Oh, I will note that the serving size on the bag is 1-3 teaspoons, but that seems like WAY too much for me. I am starting with 1/2 teaspoon and will work up to 1 teaspoon, but will unlikely go beyond that, as I already feel results with 1/2 teaspoon.",B07SWJ3QJQ,AGGTU6MPW5KXEQAXYEKALVW7FGUQ,2015-06-27 11:42:05.000

2,Alacer is a company that stands by and keeps their word,"I have tried many different brands of liquid vitamins but I feel Tropical Oasis is a superior brand to others that I have tried through the years the absorption of liquid vitamins that your body is able to absorb and use is so much higher than tablets that you can feel the improvement throughout<br /> my day.I will continue to purchase Tropical Oasis not only because of the value but also the quality.  I mix it with water, ice tea or even orange juice it mixes easily with no unpleasant aftertaste.",B001IAJZ6Q,AHBNGHWD5R6NTIK4VGCV56K6UR6A,2019-12-19 18:26:34.971
5,Its great,"Our pediatric Nurse Practioner recommended this for help with reminders for bathroom breaks, and it works like a charm! My daughter loves the two wrist bands, and has actually combined one-half pink, and one-half purple. She really enjoys all the tracker details and thus far it is extremely accurate. I have not quite figured out the camera function either, not really sure how it functions aside from it can make my iPhone take a photo, but you cannot view it on the tracker itself, so not really sure what that functionality is used for. I'll revise this review if I figure it out.<br />I'm still trying to figure out how to optimize the sleep tracker feature as well, because it appears to only kick in after a period of sedentary, non-movement, and thus it starts tracking sleep after she has actually fallen asleep. I think this may be a setting I have wrong, so I will try again.  We've only had it two days, but it's a hit with her and a help for me! Very sleek, fits well, and seems to be a winner all around. Great value!",B07VNKHMCK,AFZ3YK7XK67DMQBLVTD6ZOIBWDWA,2020-08-11 01:48:38.938

This product did NOTHING for ME, I would even have the 3 pills with coffee and Nothing, Nada. But I should have listened. I purchased this thinking.. well maybe it did not work on the individuals cautioning us not to buy this product.. Maybe.. Just maybe it would work on me. Guess again.

3,Four Stars,"I've had very good results including this in my Candida regimen.  My Candida exhibits all the MS symptoms, but this helps in kicking but on this condition.  This is best taken with other Candida supplements; I take about 10-11 other ones, including Caprylic acid, Rainbow light candida cleanse, grapefruit seed extract (gse), oregeno oil, olive leaf extract, goldenseal, licorice, garlic, etc.<br />I'm finally able to sleep again and bodywide itching is now almost completely gone.  My diet has been very spartan with no sugar or gluten, while still not eating meat or dairy, as we are vegans ( I've had the bad Candida issue for 45 years, since a teenager on lots of antibiotics and a terrible diet of meat, dairy and sugars (I did not even eat vegetables then)).",B002VLZ8C6,AG2T3BCVTHU6H2PV35G433JNKF7Q,2020-11-10 14:52:25.636

5,Great kid’s vitamin,"I take Vitamin C because it improves my iron absorption when I'm iron-loading (fights anemia) and also when I take other antioxidants (ex: vit C works synergistically with Grape Seed Extract to reduce inflammation and arthritic pain). I also take 1000mg vit C along with zinc and b12 twice a day if I feel a cold or flu coming on, and it's kept me healthy.<br /><br />I chose this form of vitamin C because I want zero fillers, and because I read a quote that, &#34;Ascorbyl palmitate is a fat-soluble form of vitamin C, which is better absorbed than ascorbic acid, the water-soluble form. It offers all the benefits of ascorbic acid, plus it won't flush out of the body as quickly as ascorbic acid, and it is able to be stored in cell membranes until the body needs it.&#34;<br /><br />Thank you Bulk Supplements, I love that these are capsules, not loose powder. :) I have enough loose powder supplements around.<br /><br />Of 4 companies' vitamin C that I've tried, this is the one I like best. No Stearates, no glycerine, no fuss. Yay!<br /><br />However, this particular Vit C does have its drawbacks -<br /><br />- I now have to take additional pills to get bioflavonoids (which are often packaged together with vit C)<br /><br />- There's only 209 mg vitamin C per pill, which is fine for some people (more than 300% of the RDA), but if you want to put 1000mg C into your system it takes a whopping 5 pills to do it.  Even if you factor in high availability, that's still 3 pills a day I need to take to get the C I want.<br /><br />Despite the cons, the pros win out for me.<br /><br />Will definitely repurchase.",B073Z8JCZP,AEIYO2BB5SM3CYLMLZ5VQB52NZ4A,2016-04-15 04:40:41.000

5,So happy I ordered it!,"I have used Vitamin E Gel for many years.  Great for cracked heals and on legs, arms and hands for dryness.  I have also used as a shaving gel for legs.  The very best use however is for sunburn.  It cures sunburn overnight.  Also for other burns.  I recently grabbed my curling iron by the hot part instead of the handle.

The easy melts worked but he gagged at the taste. I had to melt them down and put in his OJ and then his drink at lunch and he still detected it. So I bought these capsules. These have little no no effect what so ever. I have no idea the Focused Mind Jr. Easy melt chewable ones work and this doesn't. It has to have different ingredients. Ok I just looked it up and it does have different formulas. One has Inositol (that was the Jr that worked) and the other has Cognizin. The 10+ Focused Mind did nothing for my son.",B00EIS9NTY,AHPLVGCZUASVO7HMURRDWIK2WFVQ,2018-05-19 02:26:41.391

5,Five Stars,"Bought this for my 8.5 yr old son as he had been asking for a fitbit with a watch.  Benefits of this - charges really easily, stays on during all his sports, waterproof, price, style.<br />Cons: the mobile app isn't completely user friendly - it could use some user experience help.  The accuracy of the sleep tracking could also better.  Our son is usually asleep by 8:30/9pm, but the app says he isn't asleep until 11 at the earliest.  Our device settings also show the correct time zone. The step counter also seems very sensitive as he gets steps by riding in a car.<br /><br />Over all - this is a great option for kids to track activity (accuracy ok) and have a watch.  I have the mobile app on my phone as my son does not have one.  We did not connect it to receive the calls/text messages so I cannot review that piece.",B00FGP88QW,AGK2NN5GQVNJVDOTM4TAY3JBVSTA,2018-01-17 13:20:20.501

5,good,"I really like this! After spending some time doing some reading about energizing nutrients, I found that for the money this product is a deal! The slogan productivity in a bottle is definitely true. Everyone is different, but I think that anyone who tries this will at least feel less tired. For me, it gives me energy, makes me more alert, motivates, and actually boosts my mood! I've ordered this several times. The shipping is always great, They always send me an email checking in, and seem to really care about making a good product. Compared to the prices of other products on amz listed similar, why not try this? LOOK UP INGREDIENTS. I'm sure there are some other good products out there, but there's many more bad ones who use the chemical names of ingredients only to confuse buyers in an attempt to enhance the sound of the basic crap they are trying to sell at overpriced margins....<br /><br />Summary of above:<br />Works great for me. May not have the same effect for everyone, but at this price, it's worth a shot. Good long list of ingredients. Great customer service and shipping",B078SBDGGB,AET5U7U3DTQN7B6RDGCKPTEV35RA,2018-06-27 01:10:36.093

4,Five Stars,"I tried every possible kind of thermometers. I have one that you have to swipe across your forehead and the one you stick it in your ear. The last one I bought you had to stick in your year, and it was made by Brown. I own three thermometers now. Why so many? I just don’t trust any of them. However, this one beats other two and it actually matched the temperature measured by my doctor, using professional medical equipment. Not that it is most precise but you have to draw the line somewhere and trust somebody.<br />So I have to say it is the most accurate. It consistently displays most precise temperature.",B00EIS9NTY,AHI6EAYQGOQAK52M4KZMKEACEKFQ,2020-03-01 02:59:07.777

5,Organic & Price,Great product I use this product for energy and to help with lowering my blood pressure. I had so much trouble with high blood pressure I got light headed. that when I discovered this product. Which I had a doctors appointment in February and my blood pressure was normal. I was so happy. I take two tables in the morning before  I workout for energy. I also gave one bottle to my son who has had trouble with his blood pressure. He has had heart surgery and other heart problems and his blood pressure is always high. Now he has noticed a difference in his blood pressure. It has lowered a great deal.

4,Five Stars,"I deducted one star because this product doesn't dissolve easily. I gave it 4 stars because that may actually be a good thing since that may help with digestive timing. At any rate, I like the idea of a powder... even a slightly gritty one, so I can adjust my intake to suit my needs.<br /><br />UPDATE: I've found that by adding a small amount of this bulk product to Pomegranate, Blueberry, or Black Cherry syrup concentrate will allow it to dissolve quickly. Doing that lets me take the Choline Bitartrate regularly and doing it this way disguises the odd smell of the product.<br /><br />Because of the above discovery, I have changed my rating to 5 stars.<br /><br />EDIT: As pointed out to me in comments, others haven't had the problem with dissolving like I initially had (probably due to the way I was mixing the product with foods) and after only a few changes I haven't experienced that trait anymore. When my current order runs out, I will likely buy this product from this supplier again.",B07M5X9BWL,AGRG4ZUWELXZX3XP3AC7RK6LNYNA,2020-02-26 19:44:09.748

2,Good brand for me.,"The product label claims this is ""colorless"" and ""odorless"" yet there is a slight yellow tint to it and it has a distinctive smell, quite like vegetable oil.<br /><br />I've purchased different fractionated coconut oils over the years and it's become increasingly harder to get a colorless, odorless product on Amazon.<br /><br />I highly suspect it's either counterfeit and filled with another cheaper oil.<br /><br />Such a shame, really.

2,Partly my fault because I didn't notice in the picture ...,"For people looking for Phytoplankton, this is a good product...But, and this is a big but -- my experience is that it really does not have any effect on your body whatsoever.  What DOES have an effect on your body is the WATER that you drink with it.<br /><br />I tried an experiment. For one week, I took 4 to 6 drops of the phytoplankton with 12 oz of water early in the morning as soon as I woke up - I felt good every morning that week with my mood generally improved.  I thought I had really discovered something.<br /><br />I stopped taking it for a week to see if the effect was real.  That week, my mood was not as good overall.  I was generally more irritable and a bit thirsty throughout the day.<br /><br />I thought maybe the water had just as much of an effect as the Phytoplankton.  To find out whether this was the case, the third week, I took only 12 oz of water with no phytoplankton in it. I felt exactly like I did the first week.  My mood was generally improved. I felt better. And I was more productive at work.<br /><br />My conclusion is that drinking 12 oz of water immediately after waking up makes me feel better, and that the Phytoplankton is just a placebo.  It's possible that this stuff has some real effects for people, but I'm skeptical - I think it is all hype.  The real effect is because of the water you take with it.<br /><br />Don't believe me?...try it for yourself.  It won't cost you anything.  Water is free (usually).",B00OF1CY54,AF7AKMNCLLSEMPZGSGEEEDSY4KKA,2019-05-10 15:00:01.581

Due to a recent accident and then a series of medical setbacks, he has severe malnutrition, and I was hoping that this liquid multivitamin would help to turn things around for him, since liquids absorb much more easily for him. I was right! Within 2.5 days, he was showing so much improvement in his coloring, his energy level and his mental status, and the only thing that we changed was the addition of this vitamin. I would recommend this blend to any man who has issues with nutrient absorption for whatever reason.",B07M5X9BWL,AHCCQDFQCJGIAPTBFCVLUDUHU6AQ,2020-01-12 22:10:41.369

I have added it to my subscribe & save for the discount & so that I can automatically get it every 2nd Tues. of the month.

3,works great,"I had Candida a few years back and my nutritionist recommended undecenoic acid. At the time all I had heard of, for natural remedies, was a severe sugar restricted diet (still the same BTW) and caprilic acid. Some say oregano, garlic, black walnut, pau d'arco and other natural herbs help also by I have only tried garlic, which is good but I can't tell much effect. I started on the Thorne Research SF 722 and it worked within about 4 weeks, although I think I stayed on it for 6 to 8 as recommended by my nutritionist at the time. I had a recent recurrence and immediately used my leftover supply but was (my bad) not as strict about diet. As soon as I ran out of the SF 722, the Candida hit with a vengeance. I immediately ordered this on Amazon and reinitiated the stricter diet (see below). In between I tried to use caprilic acid, which works, but not as well. I started back on this and, while I can tell I am not ok yet, I can definitely tell it works. I use 6 to 8 gel caps per day. I think the bottle recommends more but, as I recall, 4 x twice a day was what my nutritionist had recommended (actually, I thought he said only once per day but it's been long enough I can't remember). It's only been less than 1 week since the 're-start so I'm still on it.<br /><br />Diet: no matter what, you have to be extremely careful. NO extra SUGAR , none, nada. No sugar added to food, none, nada, nope. Look at all labels. At the very least, 1 month. Sorry folks, that's how to fight this. My nutritionist recommended APPLES (the undecenoic acid can stop up the gut). Just don't overdo on Apple's. Another reviewer said granny Smith, yes, that reviewer is probably right but I remember using any Apple, I just only did about half a day and it worked then and seems to work now. For the same reason, DRINK LOTS OF WATER. 64 ounces a day is often recommended. If you don't, you are going to have a lot of gut problems worse than the Candida. My nutritionist recommended no fruit except Apple's and berries. I am very careful not to overdo berries but they are often lower in sugar than some fruit. Many people say to avoid ALL fruit. I'd just say at first, avoid all except green apples, lemons and limes for a couple of weeks, then add berries in small quantities.  No other fruit for 2-3 months. No sugar for longer if you can or at least 2 months. No cheese or fermented products, no mushrooms, very, very low quantities of carrots and white potatoes for at least a month. Personally I restrict almost all high starch/high glycemic carbohydrates (turn straight to sugar in the body). BUY A GOOD ENZYME AND PROBIOTIC AND EAT YOGURT. The gut needs these seriously to repair any damage done. Read up on this. Take them hours apart from taking the FS 722.<br /><br />4 diet comments: sugar in foods, sweet potatoes, grains and Stevia. (1) sugars in foods: read all labels carefully. Soup and lunch meats/sausage are two weird foods that often have more sugar than you might expect. (2) sweet potatoes: are lower glycemically than you might expect. My nutritionist recommended them and they work well for my body. If you eat them and you do not get better, eliminate, this might be a personal thing. I do NOT agree with the reviewer who said to avoid them. (3)grains, I personally am probably gluten intolerant and eating gluten may have been part of the problem. Avoid most grains, especially wheat and corn. However, my body seems to tolerate rice and many gluten-free grains, especially the &#34;seed&#34; grains and those with higher protein  (e.g. quinoa, amaranth and buckwheat) but the reviewer that cautioned against all grains may be right. I personally still eat grains but NO YEAST, NO RAISED BREAD. I eat rice crackers, rice chips (no corn added, Lundberg makes one), and my own pancakes I make with Stevia. (4) stevia: I do not agree with the reviewer on this one. Even my nutritionist recommended it. But it CAN increase your &#34;craving&#34; for sugar. With me personally, I quelled it.",B001D9DAL8,AGNMWWX3YWUDSGTUXRZUQ2PFBGSQ,2016-08-02 13:16:39.000
1,Pleasant taste,"I started taking these in part because I had read that the high levels of antioxidants might lead to some reduction in cholesterol without the side effects of cholesterol medication. I took them at the recommended dosage for several months and my last lab work did show a slight reduction in  cholesterol. I am a 67 year old guy. It took a while to notice, because it came on very slowly but my libido was beginning to decline to the point that my sexual desire was pretty low. I got to thinking and I realized that the loss in libido started some time after I starrted these. I stopped taking these and my libido is returning to its normal level. I noticed the improvement began about 3 days after I stopped taking them.<br /><br />If you should take these pay attention and make a mental note if your libido begins to decline. It takes weeks to notice it. Otherwise, I did not notice any change in my health either good or bad with taking these.",B07SYNTL34,AGEIONMQDZFLN4Y4TXJSJYPXFBSA,2020-10-24 10:11:44.580

Due to a recent accident and then a series of medical setbacks, he has severe malnutrition, and I was hoping that this liquid multivitamin would help to turn things around for him, since liquids absorb much more easily for him. I was right! Within 2.5 days, he was showing so much improvement in his coloring, his energy level and his mental status, and the only thing that we changed was the addition of this vitamin. I would recommend this blend to any man who has issues with nutrient absorption for whatever reason.",B07NQ55D5Y,AG5BPNOCCEHXTII6UDPJ535BJFYQ,2021-05-16 19:29:33.566

4,Reliable and Accurate Weight Scale,"Got this for my daughter for Christmas and she was very excited about it when she opened it.  She loved that it had two bands and immediately put the turquoise band on and put it on (I had charged it previously).  She was very excited about the high number of steps she racked up that first day, but we figured that it was because we were a bit more active and on the go than normal.  Over the next few days, we began to suspect it was not tracking steps or sleep correctly so I wore it to double check. I put it on when my daughter went to bed and wore it for a full 24 hrs.  It recorded an hour and half sleep before I ever even got in bed that night and by the time I woke up, it had already recorded over 300 steps.  When I went downstairs and made my coffee, I had over 1500 steps...there is absolutely no way that was right.  By the end of the day, It showed more than 15,000 steps which is, unfortunately, well above my typical day.  Then, a few days ago, the watch started randomly switching back and forth to military time.  I didn't even remember that being an option during set up, and couldn't figure out how to change it back, but after a few hours, it changed back on it's own.  It has changed back and forth several times now.<br />Cute watch, but very disappointing performance for my daughter's first fitness tracker and Christmas present.",B01A90FMHQ,AGUNMBORR6PFH46EUZQPM3AFJERQ,2014-12-09 02:14:01.000

Also takes accurate temperature, as I normally run low temp of 97.9, tried it out first couple days and it read 97.9. (I wasn't sick or anything).

My little hates the feel of a thermometer in his mouth, and the flexibility of this product has actually allowed me to get his temps easily without a fight.  The fast readings (time was closer to 15 seconds than the 10, but still quick and accurate) helped as well.  This thermometer also has a set of 3 faces along the side, which correspond to the temperature taken ... if below 99.5 then no fever - smiley face, if between 99.5 and 100.2 - okay face, if  higher than 100.2 - sad face.  The memory feature allows to me to quickly keep track from one reading to the next.

5,Petite vitamins for woman,"I have no baseline from which to judge these vitamins.  I feel no better or worse for taking them and question if they're worth the $60 price tag.  The taste is rough, so much so that my wife refuses to take them.  My urine 'glows in the dark' so that tells me most of the vitamins are just passing through my systems, unused, which means money wasted.  I have reduced my usage to three days a week because of this.<br />My wife and I are healthy people, eat a carnivore diet and take minor supplements.  I thought this might be good to introduce - even though it's not in the carnivore lifestyle -  but I just don't know.<br />I guess they're okay.  No reason to ding them too much except for the god-awful taste.  I can't see buying them again.",B000EBOOSO,AEUM6FJTPQ7UXVQ6IEFZR65BD2IQ,2019-12-08 17:18:17.049

4,Good stuff!,"Excellent product as have been all that I have received from BulkSupplements. All the other reviews have basically said what needs to be read, it's effective so long as you are careful with your dosing, and the only real issue, which I have with all their products, is that once you get the powder is the zip lock groove on the bags it can become problematic to close them tightly again, which can result in some clumping of the materials inside, but overall I would still rate this highly and would suggest it for the muscle recovery and nootropic factors.<br /><br />I personally can still take this on an empty stomach as part of a morning preworkout concoction and it helps burn away the grogginess and fatigue from a long day prior to give that extra motivation to get stuff done, and unlike tons of caffeine doesn't leave you feeling scattered or hyper energetic. I also purchased this of my own accord and wasn't given it as a free sample or anything else, it's simply cheaper and as far as I can tell just as effective as other brands I had been purchasing before.",B07Q4QFMYL,AHVXULQKPXPOOFKRRLJE5GSZJWVQ,2018-11-04 21:09:28.923

2,Great product for the $,"Resource Breeze has been a lifesaver for me. Last year, I started on the path to Recovery from a five year battle with anorexia nervosa. Because of my lactose aversion, I was unable to drink any of the Ensure products that are normally recommended for people who are in the re-feeding process. I was given these to drink and they tasted exactly like a fruit punch drink, Kool-aid, etc. It helped me re-gain the weight that I needed to and during the last three months, it has allowed me to train for a half marathon without worry of my weight becoming unstable again.<br />Thank you to the makers of this product.

2,Great product,"OK.  I have been asked to review this product from Zahler.  This is the 2nd time I've ordered it.  The first time it came in a bottle with a dropper that was a little faulty but seemed to work well enough (the dropper stick repeatedly came out of the rubber top and had to be reinserted before use).  My toddlers drank up their juice with vitamin D drops daily without a problem.  But then they got old enough to move a chair over to the counter where the bottle was stored.  Needless to say, it only takes about 90 seconds of unsupervised toddler time for 2 two year olds to snag a dropper bottle and bite the top off.<br />The second time I ordered the product, there was a new dispensing mechanism that did away with the dropper.  However, it is not as precise as the dropper once was.  Now, I have to give the bottle a quick shake to make a drop (only one??) come out into the glass.  While it is more child-proof, it is less precise.  I don't think it matters as much with vitamin D as it would with other supplements but it is technically a flaw.<br />I'm somewhat satisfied with the product packaging.  Regarding the actual vitamin D, all I can say is that my kids haven't developed rickets.  So I guess it's doing its job.",B00K8B6Y60,AEWQCGHEQWP3Q23VEHUOW4AUXHQQ,2018-04-06 23:01:00.764

5,Everything you need.,"I was advised by my neurologist to take 100mg Biotin per day.  This brand caused severe concentration issues to the point of not being able to follow through with many of my normal daily tasks.  I started with 100mg, increased to 200 mg the second week, and 300 the following week, spread over the day.  Had to stop as I could no longer focus for more than a few seconds.  Even the 100 mg caused issues.  I don't know if it is this brand or if I just have a different reaction than most people with MS.  It cleared up as soon as I stopped taking it.  Now I just take 10,000 mcg per day, with no difficulties.",B0037M6UWK,AF7ZXKF762B6C7ISWLX4DHDOZHFQ,2018-06-07 04:44:09.130

After a month of this cream, I did a vitamin D test last week, and my number was 37, with the range being 30-100 (so very much on the low end). Before that, my blood work after 2x5000iu tablets daily (the equivalent of one pump of this cream) was 287 (way over). This product doesn't work.

This should be the standard for all scales as saves a huge amount of time as 5-10 seconds of extra waiting everyday adds up!<br /><br />The reading stays on the screen for about 20 seconds before automatically turning off. If you want to re-weigh or have another person use it you simply have to tap the surface to re-zero.

3,"Nutritious, delicious and nut free vitamin!","As i was doing a little recent research on IBS-D, i found that a few people were giving this Wild Yam Root extract a try.  I bought a bottle from a local Vitamin shoppe and tried it out.  It's said to help stop or control spasms in the bowels and i do believe it has helped me. I also use Heather's tummy acacia fiber twice daily to keep me in check (for 3 years now.. it's a LIFE CHANGER), but the Wild Yam is a great addition. I'm glad i gave it a try. I love natural remedies over RX medications. This is my 2nd bottle. I use about 26 drops (added to any drink or even mix in with my oatmeal) twice a day. It doesn't taste good, but if added to the right drink or food you can't taste it at all. I've even added it to my coffee. ;)  It lasts about a month depending on how much you use and how often. Well worth the price. It was about $5 cheaper ordering from Amazon (as an add on for free shipping). Good stuff. I recommend it as an add on for helping IBS-D.",B07SWJ3QJQ,AF3IVMNZKEWKU3GBHZHIE62IWHYQ,2017-04-19 02:20:01.000

They are not fun to swallow for anyone.  I will be able to take all of them, but I will be very glad to move on to another competing product.

2,Slides around,"Very sweet smelling when opening bag it’s in. Like that it’s zip locked to keep fresh. I added this to my matcha green tea along with other natural supplements in the tea but I noticed this added a very nice sweet taste to the tea. I don’t use sugar in my tea so it’s very easily detected by me but it’s a subtle sweet taste that is brought out when adding raw honey to my tea as well. This red Raw Maca did not cause any upset stomach issues so that’s a plus!! I do feel a steady zip of energy within an hour, hour and a half of drinking my tea with it and lasted all afternoon and most of the evening. The most I’ve used so far in a day is 2 teaspoonfuls because I wanted to build up to the three teaspoons just in case it would case any stomach issues since it is raw. I do use a good amount of chia seeds in my tea at the time I mixed the red Raw Maca in it so that may help coat my stomach as well. The benefits of hormone balancing I can’t quite say if it has worked or not I will give it a month before I can say for sure. But overall I would recommend this company and am recommending them to co workers at work already!! Thank you Maca Team for this lovely addition to my morning tea it will be a staple forever! Definitely plan to buy a bigger bag soon!!<br /><br />Update:<br /><br />Ordered more as I am in love with this maca. Had to go off of it for a while due to medications needed at the time but started back up again and is extremely helpful with regulating Hormones for PCOS along with PCOSITOL I also purchase on amazon. Will always stick with this brand!!! Thank you for helping me manage my unfortunate disorder it has caused havoc in my life and this has saved me from being on birth control or other gross meds and also an extra oomph of energy along with it.",B07VHGX6C7,AEJCLYRXRPLTRJN2ZHR6V42XQUHQ,2020-02-08 03:27:03.203

4,Good value.,"ALL of the Barlean’s Omega Liquids are FABULOUS! My sister told me that my nieces and nephew loved to take this and I ordered some for myself and my kids. I’ve always wanted to take Omega, but I despise the fish taste. I’ve taken pills before that said “no fish taste!” And I still had a fish taste in my mouth an hour later. Y’all...these do not tase like fish AT ALL. They taste exactly like what each flavor says. We have tried 4 flavors at this point and my kids really do love them as much as I do! I will say that I think these are super expensive, and there are some months where I really just don’t have the extra money to spend on this. I wish the coat was in the $18 range. Some flavors of these are almost $30 or more, and that’s ridiculous to me. But if you’re looking for something that tastes great and that has 0 fish taste, this is the Omega product for you!!",B01J9UYQFG,AEWRUGFNGJAIMG4336VUXGYC3VYQ,2015-07-19 19:10:58.000

My daughter was undergoing chemotherapy and did not want to eat anything. She really did not like the flavor of any of the dairy type drinks. However, she really loved these drinks. She said they tasted &#34;sort of like kool-aid&#34; and was able to drink them frequently. I think she also liked that they looked like juice boxes. She was in first grade at the time, so having something that looked familiar and felt familiar to her seemed to help convince her to give them a try. In the end, she was able to maintain enough weight so she did not have to get a feeding tube, and this product was a big part of the reason why.",B003XDI3NC,AEP6JAHYMUX2OHPI56O57LN3I54Q,2017-05-21 01:20:38.000

4,Stubborn psoriasis patch.,"COMPLETELY INACCURATE!!! Every time I step on this scale, I get a different number....all within 5 minutes; and the range is within about 8 pounds! And in all fairness, I've tested it for a couple of months. I replaced my (Wonderful) Weight Watchers scale (That had lasted for years) with a cheap scale (Less than $10.00) from Walmart last year and it was adequate as a weighing device although of lightweight plastic construction and ended up cracking on one corner. When I went to replace it, I saw this one on Amazon and thought after reading the reviews that it may work as well as my old Weight Watchers scale, but at a significant savings. WRONG!!! In reality, I just dropped a $20.00 bill in the garbage can. Which is where this scale is headed. If you want any level of accuracy in tracking your weight (Which is why you purchase a scale in the first place...) DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT! I do highly recommend Weight Watchers products and from now on I plan to spend the extra money; both for accuracy and for longevity of the item.",B00OKOX5GI,AGQEXDPBBTZ2NT5AUVV5GZZS4KOA,2017-09-17 02:25:13.582

4,"This is absolutely marvelous, because it moisturize the skin ...","This vitamin contains very important nutrients that some may find difficult to be able to reach that 100% mark every day, vegan/vegetarian or or not. However this is catered to us who eat a plant based diet. I used to buy these from my local drugstore but they stopped carrying them. They are more money in the actual GNC store, which is the only place around me that sells them. So to be able to get them for cheaper is great. I feel much more energized and alert when I take these vitamins. You can definitely feel the difference between not taking them and after taking them for a few days. The shipping was very fast, two days actually. Though it shipped from Indiana and I'm in Michigan, that may have something to do with it.

It is a good looking product and the visual readout dial is easy to look at and understand.<br /><br />CONs: The calibration feature is not very precise when adjusting.

It works great as a stand-alone protein powder (to mix in with water after a workout) or as a supplement to things like smoothies. I will often throw a scoop in my breakfast green smoothies to add some protein and a touch of sweetness and flavor.  It mixes well into the smoothies. For stand-alone protein with water, make sure you use a blender bottle or something else to help really mix it up. It doesn't lump as bad as some protein powders I've used but does require a decent shake in order to break up the lumps.

2,Tastes fantastic!,I cannot take Ascorbic Acid (VITAMIN C) as I have a reaction to this version and these Multi Vitamins have Vitamin C in Ascorbate version which does not affect me in a bad way at all.

3,Rancid!,"I needed this because my skin drinks up moisturizer quickly and is prone to flaking. This calmed my skin down immediately and made it smoother. It's nourishing for the eye area and great for the neck. It is a heavy moisturizer and can make your skin tacky to the touch, so less is more in this case. It can make you feel like your skin is being covered in grease, but this can be remedied with gentle and modest application. It does have an odd scent (much like aged clothing), but it is not oppressive or offensive. I did not object to it at all.",B07MZMDMRM,AE6ICQRJNAAZDK5NKY3XLOD7HZCA,2019-05-30 11:35:08.616

3,Supplements,"I had psoriasis (diagnosed by a dermatologist) on my right arm extending from the wrist to the elbow for OVER 10 YEARS!  I tried the doctor-prescribed steroids which only temporarily cleared it up.  Found this product on Amazon while searching for any/all topical vitamin creams.  Read reviews & tried it in 7/15.  This cream successfully cleared up the patch of psoriasis in two months and it has NOT returned since.  I used only a small amount of the cream on the arm as the cream goes a long way.  Now I just put the cream on the arm 2x/week.  Also got a blood test for Vitamin D & discovered my level was far too low at 18 so I took Vitamin D in pill form at 5,000 IU 2x/day for over a year to bring levels back up to 58.  Then I read the book titled &#34;Healing Psoriasis&#34; by Pagano, D.C.  Had food allergy testing done (cost for this blood test was $200) & eliminated all allergens from my diet.",B01J8VZLK0,AFIXXHIIFAHLBKKXHNGQ66Q3HGLQ,2020-09-30 03:51:33.654

I suspected the problem might be the slightly uneven surface I had it on.  When I switched it to the tile floor in the bathroom it read a much more realistic figure, and no, I'm not telling you what that was but it was significantly more that 113.  The read-out dances around for a bit before settling on a weight which it then pulses at you.  With these old eyes, I like the large, bright read-out.  I'm guessing the black glass surface will require frequent cleaning but it just shows what my old scale hid.  It takes 4 AAA batteries which is more convenient that the unusual type batteries in my old scale.  I've only had it a few days but so far I'm quite satisfied.",B00ZB2JORC,AHKUDJHT6G42DB4U4DH7L4DSLD2Q,2014-10-24 02:51:47.000
2,Love the texture!,"Man, soon as I opened the bottle, I knew this was going to be a 'bumpy ride'.  I just started taking it, so I'll modify my rating as I evaluate the effects of the product. I think I'll start adding some lemon or lime juice to it to tone down the flavor. But it's 'powerful stuff', it's the color of rusty radiator water...",B07GNTKRBW,AGO6ZYVAHUCFF4WLVA7B4VEHEXXQ,2021-08-09 00:15:33.530
3,Bad change nutri,Just a few drops to wet hair once or twice a week. Mine and my daughters hair is much softer. I’ll also pour some in my bubble bath and love how it makes my body feel.

2,Healing capacity,The product recommends to be taken with a meal. It does work best during a meal or immediately after a meal. The taste is not too bad for a liquid vitamin.  I actually enjoy it.

4,Thank you for the delicious Vitamin B12 liquid,not sure if working or not. only been taking for a short time but it seems that my nails are growing faster. Not sure about the hair aspect. I seemed to be breaking nails a lot lately and was hoping this would help strengthen them. i haven't noticed as many hairs in the sink when i comb the hair in the morning so who knows if it is helping retain them.

5,Garbage,"I really wanted to like this cream, given all of the good reviews. I have not found any real change in my skin while using this but it may be because the smell is a huge deterrent in using this more consistently.  I usually put it on at night but it the smell keeps me up sometimes and I am generally not sensitive to smells.

Since I was recommended all natural nootropics and purchased this Limitless product, I have definitely felt a difference and have found it a bit easier to focus and remember things.

2,Excellent watch for such a reasonable price. Worth much more.,"I bought this to use as a diaper ointment, but after using it a few times, it gave my baby a diaper rash. I'm assuming it was the fragrance. Also, the packaging is really poor. It arrived a mess, and required that you clean a good bit of product out of the lid and around the edge before being able to use it without getting it all over.

4,beware - it may not be what it seems,"Pros: Cheap, reasonably accurate, easy to use and read.<br />Cons: Cheap, low quality control.<br />I liked this scale because it came in grey; a nice contrasting color less likely to show prints. Plus, it was pretty much the same as higher priced models. Well, the low price comes with it's drawbacks. It failed within 36 hours. I asked for a replacement and it was hassle free. Mind you that doesn't include the hassle of dropping off the dead unit at the UPS store. The new one arrived reasonably quickly and has been functioning for the last three days. So, maybe it will last; but I'm keeping the packaging until the 30 day return period expires just in case.  I recommend you do the same. That said, the light on the digital readout is a bit askew compared to the previous unit and doesn't equally light up the display. While a bit annoying, it's not enough reason to return it. However, it does indicate rather sloppy assembly and low quality control. Like I said, you get what you pay for. If you don't mind the possibility of spending time returning one of these for a replacement; it's a reasonable scale at a good price.",B00RU8MEUO,AHI4O3OX2GBQ5PXQ3FESBA3GG6OQ,2018-07-09 17:21:07.659

3,Great Value for the Price -- just a bit TART,Gave a 2 star for the taste not being to bad. Unfortunately I noticed no benefits from this. Truckers turbo in the truck stops did a lot better. This may be because of it being short of full vitamins and a low amount of the ones it has.

The last one I bought you had to stick in your year, and it was made by Brown. I own three thermometers now. Why so many? I just don’t trust any of them. However, this one beats other two and it actually matched the temperature measured by my doctor, using professional medical equipment. Not that it is most precise but you have to draw the line somewhere and trust somebody.<br />So I have to say it is the most accurate. It consistently displays most precise temperature.",B018FBMOQS,AHI6BIABORVQMWOCMWXHNXOSFR5Q,2020-01-27 04:34:06.223

3,Excellent prenatal skincare,"I've been taking high potency multi vitamins pill form most my life. Friends would say pill form was a waste of money, with poor absorption rate. I always kept an eye out for a liquid high potency vitamin. I compared a few other liquid brands out there and found High Vitality has everything I wanted, in a liquid form. Ordered 2 bottle's and couldn't wait to see what a high potency liquid multi vitamin looked and taste like. Let me tell you, it looks like baby food, a very thick milk shake type liquid. The taste is surprisingly good, like a shot of a fruity milk shake, not bad at all.",B004Z8UXC8,AH2O42527K7RR5CBLGYYN36QWTSA,2021-05-03 20:36:33.809

My mother introduced me to this product years ago.  I have minimal wrinkles around my eyes and mouth.  As I age, my skin is getting so dry especially around the eyelids.  OMG! I tried using other products to try them out but I always end up going back to this creme!  I used it on the talent during a movie shoot.  The weather was cold and I needed a good base for the professional makeup.  This was wonderful.  It preformed great, wrinkles were kept to a minimum on camera.  The actress I worked on is well known and has a reputation for good looks.  Well, she looked great on film.  Thanks for a great product that really works.

4,It tastes disgusting by itself,"It's been frustrating finding a high quality vegan multivitamin.  Finding one that really gives me what I'm missing instead of just giving me everything and hoping my needs are covered. OptiVego really did their research.<br /><br />I believe in balance and that the way to a healthy body is to meet your macro nutrients. Eating vegan means I sometimes miss out on essential vitamins. I'm happy that OptiVego is so focused on balance. There is so much scientific information on their website but it is presented in a very easy to understand way. I've gained complete confidence in these vitamins, knowing I will get what my body needs.<br /><br />When they first arrived, I felt like having to take them twice a day was a down side, but the capsules are so small that it was just a matter of adding it into my routine. The more I think about it, taking them more than once a day means my body is continually receiving the nutrients it needs to consistently function well, instead of having highs and lows.<br /><br />I'm very happy with my purchase, and with the peace of mind I get knowing my body is well taken care of.",B078SBDGGB,AFHUU7TRISH7UYWWZFVEIXOAFXXQ,2019-06-24 22:42:45.533

3,Good quality,"I'm glad to have a vegan formula for my Omega-3's.  It seems like the formulation is adequate supplementation.  But the taste?  I have to say I really don't like it.  It's not horrible, but the xylitol (although a natural sweetener) makes for a very weird artificially sweet taste.  Way too sweet for me.  But it's a vitamin and as vitamins go, it could certainly taste worse.  So it's good for function, yuck for taste (in my opinion--I know other people love the taste--but I'm not sure why).",B07VHGX6C7,AHNASRJQUDVQ54BXRTSCQCFP2JHA,2017-07-25 06:58:52.047

Helps if you cut down on coffee and soda too.",B003XDI3NC,AGOU5ZFUISGCLLVIQFA7RE4OT5JA,2021-01-11 20:41:17.753
4,Highly recommend,"Bought this end 2018.  Did it work?  Had we just been taking some odorless, tasteless, pretty pink colored cornstarch all this time? As vegans we needed to know.  Ten years ago my B12 blood level measured in the low 200s (pg/ml), borderline by US standards, deficient by Japanese standards.  Last week's B12 tests for my wife and me read 747 and 840 pg/ml, putting to rest any doubts about the efficacy of this product.  Furthermore, I contacted Belle Chemical and they confirm that this product is made in the US and gets independently tested for arsenic, lead and heavy metals. I'll be happily re-ordering.",B078SBDGGB,AE4WKFKGMWRQMBJVEKPINM6N5LGQ,2016-05-20 21:17:31.000
4,Value of money,"I purchased this for 2 reasons...1) I love the brand and 2) The Doctor ordered me to. Recently went to an appointment and my Lupus Dr explained to me that my vitamin B levels were very low and suggested the B-Complex. As I have mentioned here before I do have lupus so vitamins and supplements play a very important part in being healthy and keeping a flare at bay. This B-Complex is just what i needed. I immediately started taking them when they arrived in the mail. When i go back to the Dr. next month I am hoping that all my levels will be normal and i can continue on with my life, such as it is. Great Vitamin!!!",B07MKGM64W,AFEMNDCPISRQYDFLXC5BB4OELN2Q,2022-02-21 17:38:23.495
2,Two Stars,"Great packaging, it was exactly what I was looking for.  The powder is high-quality and mixes easily with just about anything you'd like.  As long as you mix it in something with a strong scent (like chocolate, or cinnamon) the taste isn't noticeable.<br /><br />This is hands down the best quality for the best price.

Before I was a vegetarian I would get gummy vitamins and they worked great. Now I obviously can't eat gelatin so I've been searching for a good vegan gummy. These are great. The texture is like Swedish Fish not your traditional gummy but still yummy. It has a bit of a vitamin aftertaste but that's to be expected and I feel really good every day so I think it's doing the trick",B07F7JXLLC,AF4RZSP46ARKMDSEYI2TKKKK66UA,2021-01-08 01:30:33.433

5,"Nice product, much better than the tablet under the ...","I'm glad to have a vegan formula for my Omega-3's.  It seems like the formulation is adequate supplementation.  But the taste?  I have to say I really don't like it.  It's not horrible, but the xylitol (although a natural sweetener) makes for a very weird artificially sweet taste.  Way too sweet for me.  But it's a vitamin and as vitamins go, it could certainly taste worse.  So it's good for function, yuck for taste (in my opinion--I know other people love the taste--but I'm not sure why).",B012OM4DQ8,AFJU3JMC7Z7RBPDJ53JT3GUBEWGQ,2022-03-03 06:13:31.591

All 3 at once is awesome but if your like me, you'll want to space them out some.  I usually take 2 in the morning,& 1 more mid afternoon. I have energy all day & ready for bed come night  time.

I imagine these work very well for oil or anything that is more liquid than the thicker stuff that I use. So far they haven't broken.

After trying the product, I can say it does strenghten the nails and makes them healthier, but it will take about a month -- or more -- before you see any improvement.  It's expensive, but shop around.  I have not compared it's effectiveness to the biotin vitamin supplement, but the vitamin supplements seem to be a much larger tablet for the same dose or you may have to take several tablets to equal their dose.

4,It works,"This all in one formula is a blend of many super focused, high quality vitamins, minerals and herbs based in a liposomal formula, making it easier for the body to absorb. This is actually a big deal (less wasted through the digestive process) especially for those buying it for alcohol recovery; most of us have impaired digestion. The price of the supplement is pretty high but if you consider the absorbability and not having to buy individual supplements, it really does round itself out cost wise. It is also extremely useful for those not wanting to take lots of capsules.<br /><br />The taste is one of those things that really can only be determined by your preference and your own taste buds. I have an issue with stevia and always have but I don’t hate the flavor and it smells really nice. However it is a bit too sweet for me personally so I found a neat and healthy way to lighten it up and make it tasty and refreshing (recipe will follow).<br /><br />I found that with my unresolved gut issues and otherwise sensitive stomach taking a whole scoop makes me feel queasy, so I suggest starting with half a scoop. This is an added bonus for cost effectiveness - it lasts twice as long this way. Experiment to see what works best for your own body and see what kind of difference it can make for you.<br /><br />I haven’t been taking it long enough yet to say what benefits I’m seeing, but will be happy to update my review accordingly.<br /><br />Using organic ingredients I blend the following together and pour over ice and enjoy!<br /><br />½ cup plain cranberry juice<br />½ cup plain black or green tea<br />⅛ cup aloe juice<br />1 teaspoon lemon juice<br />½ - 1 scoop of BioRebalance",B000JWK4DM,AFDMORUHSGVQGWKMXL4JJ26W3WKQ,2016-05-15 02:41:04.000

I was not looking for a fancy scale, all I wanted was reliable weight measurement. That is not possible with this scale (at least the one I had!) I was immediately suspicious when I first weighed myself and the weight was 4 pounds more than my normal weight. I got off the scale and waited for it to reset and got on again to find that I had magically &#34;lost&#34; 2 pounds. I then waited for the scale to reset (which actually takes a LONG time - but not long enough to lose 2 pounds!) again and weighed myself again and amazingly I had &#34;lost&#34; another pound. I tried multiple readings several times over the period of a week and NEVER got the same reading 2 times in a row from this scale. I did contact the company and they were very accommodating and immediately refunded 1/2 of my money in case I decided I didn't want to bother returning the scale, but also included a prepaid UPS return label to send the scale back for a full return of the purchase price.",B07QLN739N,AHIRHVCFVTFJMPTBLFMTTXSVN44A,2017-03-30 21:44:35.000

Well, now my go to product to fall asleep at night.  If you are like me and your mind races the minute your head hits the pillow...this will help!! I apply a full pump right before bed on my inner arm, where my psoriasis is and then rub it in both inner arms.  It really helps the psoriasis stay controlled and helps me easily fall asleep!!

Immediately this one felt like it drained all of my swollen glands in my neck instantly and my upper arm skin started to clear up its pink color & raised bumps slowly but surely. And the most interesting thing- my eye floaters that I've had my entire life that are so prevalent they sometimes make it hard to see/read started disappearing. When I ran out my throat started to swell back up and the long chain eye floaters have come back.<br />I have no real basis for this theory but it truly feels like this helps carry the rest of my med payload to the places it needs to get to to clear out the yeast.<br />Eagerly awaiting my next bottle so I can resume my offensive.",B07MT7LVV2,AEX4XXNHAF76X54RV3PLQUJNQAHQ,2022-12-11 17:25:26.884

I've been taking a dose or two daily and I definitely have noticed a difference over time, a positive one. By itself, it works well enough over time to reduce mental fog. But when you take it with other vitamins and nootropics, it really does wonders in keeping your energy from being sapped when working or studying too much. I've taken it with modafinil and racetams and I definitely enjoy it.

3,Good quality for a good price,I had seen a review where the glass had shattered upon the first use but I thought surely it was a fluke. I did use the scale for about one week and just barely tapped it with my foot when walking by it. It instantly shattered and glass went everywhere. I am disappointed that it was so fragile and only lasted a few days before breaking.<br /><br />Update: The manufacturer contacted me about the one star review I left for their product. They immediately refunded my purchase price and shipped me a new scale. The new scale was easier to set up and pair with my phone. It is currently working. I have raised my review to 3 stars. After 45 days if the scale is still working as expected then I will again edit my review and raise to 5 stars based on the excellent customer service I received.<br /><br />The scale has now been working for 45 days and I am both pleased with the product and the customer service I received.,B01COW00O2,AF266JJWOEJD5AZD7CXGVTF2IIKA,2019-02-13 23:31:54.681

I purchased the 1000 mg so I could take it all at once, but maybe I should have looked to see how large they are. I would have been better off buying  500 mg, and smaller. Now I am stuck with these giant pills they are one inch long and almost and if I measured correctly over 1/2 &#34; wide for three months,If they were chewable that would not be a major problem. Size is a big issue for me, if it is for you I would choose another.",B000FGXMWC,AH5S5UMAJJWBDQBKC3FNWX4VVSTQ,2017-11-14 22:45:26.417

You have to take 4 of these horse pills a day. That's about $2 a day. The back says you should take them at different meal times and for me I barely remember once. The capsule is extremely thick, to the point I don't want to try ingesting them. They open very easily but the powder is tough on the stomach and smells/taste rough.

5,Five Stars,"I have had a small patch of plaque psoriasis on my knee for years. I have tried everything - this is the only thing that has ever seemed to show visible improvement quickly. If it keeps getting better I will update this review if I find time. The thing is, I usually wear pants, so the cream just gets absorbed by my jeans, and yet it still seems to be working. Only reason I wrote this review and will update it is because I know how bad it must be if you have patches in other places, and if it works for me and maybe helps some other people then I did some good. I am fair skinned and used to have reddish light brown hair. Now it's mostly gray lol.",B00F7OZJR8,AHGCTJSAWCYPSZEXVKSLQHBGNMOQ,2020-09-12 19:40:20.023

4,... about 3years ago on some diet plan and was like WTF? Barf,This scale totally gets the job done for the right price. Can’t go wrong here. No skimping in quality either like I was afraid of.,B000FGXMWC,AG77QIQ7YCKEP5H3H2FB4PKD7S4Q,2020-07-20 15:05:17.955
4,Value for money,"Product arrived quickly and was as advertised.  I'm on my forth month of taking this supplement.  This brand has less clumping when added to hot water, than the other brand I was using, but the ratio is different. So I buy both and blend them.  Seems my hair is growing faster, next haircut will tell if the roots are grey or not.  (I'm dirty blonde, hard to see) so far I believe in this product, and will buy more.",B00454A1HE,AECW5WLB3JQ2AKWJU3TWTLKMSLVA,2017-07-17 16:32:24.431
3,I feel so much better when I take this,"I'm not sure what this stuff actually is but it gives me an infection every time I start it up --- I'm going to throw the rest of the bottle away before I go through another month of trying to balance myself out again. I'm bummed it didn't work for me but I would strongly advise you take this product under supervision of medical professional, as it does do something. What it is for me, is not good.",B00VWID4YS,AGGWFBZZZ6OKJFEI6UJBNH4Y2IQQ,2016-10-29 21:49:33

3,Satisfied,"This supplement is promoted as being really effective against candida. That might be the case, but it makes everyone constipated. And when you're constipated, the candida has more time to feed on what's moving through you. You're basically attacking it, but then nursing it back to health at same time. Makes this supplement useless.<br /><br />Check out 100% gum spirits turpentine for a real cure to candida and other pathogens.",B00VWID4YS,AH6Y5SUDOTZ5DCYWVFUZFHLEJ26Q,2021-09-13 12:24:28.485

5,Five Stars,The taste was terrible. Had sort of an oily composition that lingered in your mouth for some time. After a few days my face broke out so I quit using it immediately. By then there was no return so it ended up down the drain. Bad experience.,B07VLN1YB4,AGAPBRBIJYPWUOPFKAE6SWUXJXGQ,2022-10-29 19:17:32.670

4,Three Stars,"First off I used to love this product and highly recommended it. But this last time it gave me an awful reaction. Flushed face , felt overheated and turned red. I also started getting really itchy and rashes started developing throughout my body. This happened to me a few times but could not pinpoint to what was causing it until one day I took it and felt it immediately. So I decided to go to the reviews here on Amazon to see if this was the actual problem. I came to discover I was not the only one that went through this. Guys please stay away from this. All the bad reviews to read about this is 100% right.<br /><br />My bottle was not expired nor tampered with. There is something going on with how they making it that is not safe for consumption. Please stay away",B002BQ3EHM,AHTRXYLSMF727EJLMMKT6XEXVVPQ,2018-06-20 02:23:10.566

3,No accuracy,"This is the second time I've bought one of these because my daughter took the last one I had, she loved it so much! So many great options with this activity tracker/watch. Things I love about it...<br />1. It lights up with movement of my arm.<br />2. It is super easy to download and use the mobile app with my droid smart phone.<br />3. It doesn't track steps right away, so you get less false readings.<br />4. I can set an alarm to go off at any time of the day and have it vibrate to remind me to take my medications.<br />5. I can set goals for my steps and I can have it remind me to move if I am sitting too long<br />6. It notifies me of when I reach my daily goal!<br />7. I love how easy it is to charge<br />8. Keeps a charge for several days!<br />9. Fits very well and doesn't slide and is not bulky to wear.<br />10. Variety of color band options available to match outfits.<br />11. Easy to read screen, I don't need to find my reading glasses to read it.<br />12. Counts calories burned<br />13. I can use it to find my phone!!!! What!? Amazing! Yes, if my phone can't be found, I can use this tracker to make my phone ring until I find it. I would buy it just for that option alone.<br />14. Doesn't break the bank to buy this top quality tracker, what's not to love about that?!",B00O8W7NVU,AG3LG2J3JVSBUMH2KHGXSMK7OFVQ,2017-11-18 14:20:43.542

5,died a little over in a little over a year year,"This is the best product I have ever used on dry skin and rashes.  This cream cleared up a chronic rash caused by my leg and back massager.  Nothing I have used, including hydrocortisone cream, cleared up this rash, but the Aloe Propolis cream makes it disappear after a couple of applications.  It's pricey, but well worth the expense.  I live in a dry climate so it's a godsend.  I'm very pleased.",B00OKOX5GI,AGIQZTXTIH44I2AJVXD6QKDTFGOQ,2016-10-18 16:43:25.000
5,"They are ok, the black one broke though.","Already bought second bottle due to a friend sharing the first one.  They're getting good results, too.  I honestly started seeing my face calm down a little after the first night.  I'd been breaking out so much just before.  Now when I take off makeup, I'm just going from a dramatic face to a normal face, not to excessive breakouts that are being covered up.<br /><br />Anyway, I don't want to be Captain Obvious here but I wanted to mention that this formula contains vitamins A, D, and E, which are fat soluble.  From what I understand, you don't need to consume a vat of lard whenever you take these, but if some meals consist of a banana or a black coffee while rushing out the house, maybe that's not the best meal to take with these vitamins.",B003PRICN2,AFWFRKCFGXLPLELT7NFU6G5LULQQ,2020-09-08 23:35:03.960

Immediately after I took a couple of capsules I turn the bottle around and read the label very carefully. Lo and behold it's only 50% purity!  This means that for two capsules that you take you're not getting 600 mg of pure Alpha GPC, but rather, you're only getting 300 mg. If you are looking for pure Alpha GPC at 100% purity look elsewhere... Very disappointed!",B06XXW2FKQ,AHN3LWNNYW3YIBWIRQXO7Q5EYXUQ,2018-06-25 22:36:30.009

3,i love it.,"Update:<br />After my first scale did not work properly the company and its reps reached out and we found a solution. Although the original malfunctioned they made every effort to make it right going above and beyond.<br /><br />Didn’t work properly. Weight was different every time you stepped on the scale and I mean every time. Seconds after you weighed yourself it would read 5 lbs heavier, 3 lbs lighter and so on and so forth. Utterly useless.

Mind you I took 1 a day, few days and than took a break.  I started breaking out in hives, but didn't realize it is this product.  After I took a break it went away.  Later I took it again, and sure enough I broke out in hives, painful and swollen and itching.  Ouch, I don't intend to take it ever again.  I don't have allergies but there's something in this that caused me to react to it.<br />Be careful that's all!!!

5,Beautiful and accurate.,"This is a great at home scale to have! The price is great, shipping was obviously quick, and the scale works just as its supposed to.

5,Work Great... Accurate and Fast,DO NOT BUY. Used it weekly for about 4 months. Now the numbers keep going up and down without stopping +/-50lbs. And it won’t weigh anything above 140lbs.

I have compared it with the cuff around the arm and the BP is not been read accurate. I have high BP and is why I need it to read my BP but I’ll keep looking for another one. This one does not work. I also went to the doctor and when they took my BP it was normal, them I immediately took it with the FT and it said it was high.

3,Works Great,If I could give it 0 starts I would. After putting it in the refridgerator it still tasted bad. There is nonway that the dosage of 2 Tbsp is correct. I cut it down to 1/2 tsp and it still made me feel really groggy. Either my bottle was tainted with something or their vitamin mix is way to concentrated for the dosage they recommend. After cutting my dosage in half daily I stopped taking it and immediatly felt better the next day and a few days later. Went back to my other daily vitamin and dumped this stuff down the drain.

4,Seems to work for me,"When I opened the jar, a third of it was already gone, which was a bit shocking. I now suspect that I may have gotten a jar with a giant air bubble in it, as it was there was a giant cavity in the jar rather than a uniformity. I guess I'll know for sure when I order a second jar.<br /><br />This is a very effective product. The fact that vitamin E is the second ingredient is AMAZING. I can't find another product like this. I used it over the period of a day on a shallow cut on my arm and the skin sealed up within 24 hours. It is very good for scars. Not so good for the face though - I broke out in pimples when I used this on my face. I have oily skin, and when I woke up in the morning there was an oily sheen on my face. It would probably work for dry skin though. I would recommend this to anyone who wants healed scars and soft skin, and possibly a night cream.",B00F7OZJOQ,AEJVV44NJX4OD7UPL55ZZAJDZM7A,2018-08-21 18:05:27.281

5,Taste so GOOD and quantity for price is awesome!,"I read that high nitric oxide levels in the brain are one of the causes of migraines and hydroxycobalamin is the only form of B12 that lowers nitric oxide levels. But I had tried another brand of hydroxycobalamin in a lozenge form and and it actually caused a worse headache for me which I thought was strange, but I guess it must be the additives they use in the lozenges that are not used in these capsules that make the difference. These capsules do not cause a headache for me although I have only been taking them for five days.",B00454A1HE,AGLOIXV674ZU3KMNIAUZAZJ5DHKQ,2022-01-31 00:47:22.618

2,Didn't seem to have much effect but for the price ...,"One reviewer has done us all the favor of doing the math to tell us this product is 50% water. Whether that's true or not is totally irrelevant to me because I have suffered with digestive issues my whole life and this product has been a miracle. My mother recently purchased 100% flax oil. I didn't think much of it and swallowed a tablespoon of it and had that awful taste in my mouth for almost 24 hours. So, I concluded that I'd much prefer to take just one tablespoon a day of this and marvel at how great it tastes and even more importantly how fantastically it has healed my digestive track. If you want 100% flax oil you may want to add it to some food that will literally cover up the taste and I'm not even sure if that's possible. Flax seeds on the other hand are easily added to a smoothy and leave no after taste. But this product has made it so convenient and so great tasting that I will use it as long as I live! Yes, it's that fantastic!",B00GI3S622,AF37TLVGJKZ45PVBMJWG6TTRS3RQ,2016-01-13 02:00:49.000

5,Not for me,"I've been taking these for a while.  I am athletic and over fifty so I thought that this particular formulation would be good to try.  They are a tasty treat for me each day and I don't forget to take them.  The development of gummy vitamins has been great for me because I don't like swallowing pills and usually stop taking supplements after a while when I have to.  I don't have the answer to the question as to whether taking multivitamins each day provides significant health benefits but I figure it can't hurt.  My feeling is that because so many nutrients are processed out of many of the food products that we consume that a vitamin supplement is necessary to get sufficient amounts of what we may not be getting from<br />our diet.  Even though I eat pretty healthy, mostly organic food, I still think there is a benefit to taking vitamins and I think that this is a very good product to fill that need.",B00TYQ7IBK,AHVSKOZXKLW3C4UQA3ACRWHBHFBA,2017-09-08 21:29:12.894

3,Three Stars,"As a little bit of background, my wife and I recently began meeting with a personal trainer to begin our journey of losing weight and becoming more fit. When we began we bought a withings body smart scale to try and track our data at home. At the same time, we get real tests done at the trainer’s and we can compare the actual tests with the tests of the withings scale. Now, we have a Eufy Smart Scale and so most of my review will compare the Eufy scale to both the withings scale, and the information from our official testing done by our trainer.<br /><br />Spoiler Alert/Readers’ Digest Version: 5/5<br />We gave away our withings scale. The accuracy and functionality of the Eufy scale far surpassed that of the Withings body smart scale. The withings incorporates your data with more third parties (Eufy now integrates with Google Fit and Heath Kit)  and can be used to track your data without opening the app, but my opinion is: What good is  data tracking if the data is wrong to begin with? The Eufy scale’s data was within decimals of the exact data provided by our tests done at the trainer’s, the withings’ data was not even close throughout the test, other than weight itself. The mass breakdowns of the Eufy were nearly dead-on to the real numbers and so it is a better product in my eyes. Definitely recommending the Eufy!<br /><br />Design: 5/5<br />When I read/write reviews I am not usually all that concern with the look of the product. Some people care a lot about the visual design of a product etc, not me, not usually anyway. I normally care about the functionality, so I skim over looks. With that being said, it goes to show just how great this scale looks when I say that when I opened the box, the first thing I noticed was how incredible the scale looks. It looks fantastic; very sleek, very smooth, very gorgeous. I have the white model and it looks great! In comparison to my withings scale, it is much more attractive and pleasant to have in the house.<br /><br />Set Up: 4.5/5<br />The set-up was mostly simple. There were a few hiccups the first time I stepped on the scale after setting up my profile. It didn’t transmit the information at first. I had to shut down the app, then try again and it worked fine, and has every since. When my wife set up her profile it did the same to her. Probably a bug, but it worked perfectly after that. Overall, a simple process and worked well. To set it up just download the EufyLife app, select add new device, choose the scale, step on the scale to turn it on, pair the app with the scale, once paired select the scale, add a new profile, input your information, then use it!<br /><br /><br />Usage: 4.5/5<br />I am going with 4.5 in the actual usage of the scale on a regular basis. It is dead simple, and it works great! You just click the button in the app and you are ready to go. It scans very quickly and reports your weight to you fast. In comparison to the withings scale I purchased previously it is less convenient due to the withings scale not requiring the app to be opened in order to transmit the data to the phone. I can see people caring about this. I personally do not. I always have my phone at the times I want to weigh myself, and I always look at the data right after weighing and scanning, so for me it works perfectly. I can just see some people not wanting to have to open the app to record the data, so that is the .5 point. But for my own personal use it gets a 5/5 for sure.<br /><br /><br />Functionality: 6/5<br />Yes, I meant to give it a 6/5. It deserves it! This sucker is accurate and it gives me so much data to use in my journey to becoming more fit. As mentioned, I compared the data of this scale to my actual test data from my trainer and to my withings smart scale. It wasn’t even close. For example, My trainer had my body fat percentage as 25.6%, the Eufy reported it to be 25.7%, the Withings showed 19.8%. Now, while flattering, the withings’ data was not even close and therefore is useless to me. My wife’s result were identical to mine. Her Eufy scan reported a body fat percentages within 0.7% of the trainer’s while the withings’ report was 10% off. Some other examples:<br /><br />Weight<br />Trainer: 185.5<br />Eufy: 185.6<br />Withings: 185.1<br /><br />BMI<br />Trainer: 27.5<br />Eufy: 27.5<br />Withings: 27.4<br /><br />Muscle<br />Trainer: 35%<br />Eufy:35%<br />Withings:20%<br /><br />Not only is the data more correct with the Eufy smart scale, it has more types of useful data than the withings. It reports:<br /><br />Weight<br />Body Fat %<br />BMI<br />Water %<br />Muscle %<br />Bone %<br />BMR<br />Visceral Fat<br />Lean Body mass<br />Body Fat mass<br />Bone mass<br />Muscle mass<br /><br />The withings does not even report most of these to begin with, and the Eufy reports them accurately! It reported the exact same lean body mass as my trainer did with his assessment!<br /><br />Now, there are some limitations regarding functionality when compared to the withings scale. Integrating the data into third party apps. This is something withings does very well. The data from withings can automatically be synced with my fitness pal, etc. THE EUFY DOES LINK WITH GOOGLE FIT AND HEALTHKIT NOW. The Eufy does not sync with myfitnesspal, but I don't really care. I like to keep my data separate so as to use the full features of each (i.e. my fitness pal for calories and macros and EufyLife app for body data). I find that integrating with other apps is fine and all, but accessing the data in those other apps is usually limited so I don’t really care. My main opinion here is: What good is third party integration and data tracking if the data is wrong to begin with? So I am not even taking off points for this.<br /><br />I like the fact that multiple users can use this scale. My wife and I both use it daily just fine and our respective apps record the data so we can view it. It can support up to 20 people I believe, though I am not too sure who needs that many.<br /><br />Overall: 5/5<br />This is a fantastic scale. It is so useful for us as we work to get fit. The truth is, we gave our withings scale away because we so much prefer this Eufy scale to the withings body. If you have any questions between the two, I strongly recommend buying the EUFY over the withings. It provides much more useful and accurate data, and it looks great while doing it!",B008PPXD9M,AH7JQQJXJT7ZTDVHTBEVY4Z6KWXQ,2019-11-04 23:04:15.584

I also have come to really hate swallowing pills after years of big chunky vitamins.  This lead me to search for gummy, chewable vitamin formulations that give you the nutrition you need without pills.  Finding this brand was such a joy!  I have tried several of their vitamins, but this one is the best by a long shot of the ones I have tried so far, and the best of all brands I have tried of any gummy vitamin, period.  The flavor and texture are extraordinarily delicious!  They taste better than candy!  They are SO good, in fact, that it takes a supreme act of will to stop myself from eating many more than the serving size!  This is truly a gourmet vitamin, and I never imagined I would ever say that as a sentence!  I also appreciate the company’s use of resealable bags instead of plastic bottles, which are much less wasteful.  Our flagrant use of plastics is already coming back to haunt us in many ways.

4,Broke my face out.,"I have been taking 'One N Only' for well over 2 years now, and I feel safe in writing a 5-star review for these amazing vitamins! I have to say these are the best multi-vitamin I have ever bought. They absolutely cause NO discomfort if you take them on an empty stomach, and I have had several bad experiences with other harsh brands causing instant upset, etc. Next, you get a great deal of energy, these are loaded with B vitamins. I haven't had any adverse effects and really have had an overall positive experience. Well worth the price tag, I noticed my hair growing better, my nails becoming stronger and my energy levels increased. If you are on the fence, I would recommend getting a bottle and trying them, since they have really worked well for me.<br /><br />The only drawback some may have is these are naturally packed with lots of nutrition which does  make for a big pill, but they're no worse than a Centrum, or any other multi that I have tried. Not too bad of a taste, kind of grassy/mineral flavored.",B00VWID4YS,AGMYN5UIZLVL4MGXMBFFSEHDXOFQ,2017-01-29 18:37:29.000

4,Not working,"Product has changed. Menthol now in cream. Loved this product before menthol was added, now it burns my skin. I used it for rosacea and it was calming and helped with the redness.

3,Ok,"Got sick and ordered this to check my temperature. It is quick and easy to get a reading. The problem is that if you do multiple readings back-to-back-to-back, you will never get the same reading and the difference can be up to 2 degrees.

Without even asking for a refund because I was out of the return window, much delight the seller saw my review and reached out to offer a refund. That’s great business in my book!  ORIGINAL REVIEW-Would give a rave review but after a few months of rare use, it’s gone non functional. It keeps saying Lo backwards on the screen. Have changed batteries to brand new ones and it still says this error message or won’t even come on at all. Return window is closed which isn’t really fair because product stopped functioning months later.",B01A90FMHQ,AFLARFZM446LGOLXTAPLD2Y5444A,2016-07-20 19:24:01.000
4,Five Stars,"I bought these because I lost the softer, comfy ones I bought for my Littmann. They work alright but are harder and less comfortable than what I replaced. At least they come in packs of 10 because I've already had to replace 2—nothing to do with their quality but I pocket my ears so they've gotten caught on whatever as I exit the ambulance.<br />Overall, not bad and worth the money but I'd prefer something more comfortable in the future.",B07MZMDMRM,AECY6NVZFCCM7Y4NM5M6IOJU63XQ,2014-10-10 19:53:35.000

They are sweet and gummy but I saw no results except for a pimple on my forehead which I never had before  and I drink lots of water.<br />I  got better and faster results from  Nature's bounty  which I will go back to.

4,Miracle stuff!,"It is much wider than most scales, good for my giant husband. Price was good even though the reading the numbers is strange. While standing on the scales, the numbers are very very dim or missing and flash rapidly between numbers. We stand as still as we can while counting to ten, then step off. Once we are off the scale, the number shows up big and bold.

I received it yesterday and aside from the fact that it only came with 2 of the 4 included batteries-- no biggie, just had to use our own brand new ones-- this scale weighed everyone in our family OVER 60 lbs more than our normal weight!. We did have some fun seeing how &#34;fat&#34; we were, but it serves no reliable purpose to have around when you're trying to keep track of your actual weight. There is no way to calibrate it, so I need to return it to Amazon. Waste of money-- other that the fact that it's sleek and pretty, it serves no purpose!!!",B01A90FMHQ,AETQO3DDLOQ3RKHFP4YUISNY64AA,2022-02-14 18:00:21.032
4,Slather it on at bedtime.,"My regular brand of glucose tabs were out of stock so tried these. The flavors are really good - better than my other brand, but the potency didn't seem quite the same as my other brand. Ended up needing 2-3 tabs to get sugar up vs just 1-2 of my other brand. These tabs were also super powdery - that is something I found very annoying as I would get powder all over when getting the tabs out of the container (note to new users - don't turn the bottle over to get your glucose tabs out - you'll have a mess on your hands and all over everything else around you)! That said, they did their job once I got the dose down and I thought all the flavors were delicious.

4,I don't know if this thing works for gray hair ...,"For my 17 year old daughter. This is her second box, and she actually got it for her hair. Her friend said that while it didn't happen overnight ...her friends hair grew stronger and longer.<br />My daughter's hair is fried from the 'flat iron'. And though she's used quality products on the outside of her hair, I've always read that good hair begins ""inside"" the scalp and body. As a normal teenager, she doesn't have the best of diets. I do what I can about the vegetables and fruits, but you know how that goes.<br />Could be our imagination, but her hair DOES seem a bit thicker, not as much breakage, and definitely looks smoother. Her nails are most definitely not 'peeling' and thin.<br />Received the product super fast and in mint condition. There are flat foil packets in the box. Each packet has about a months worth of pills and the days of the week are marked at the top of each packet. You 'punch' the pill out through the foil on the back of the packet.<br />Could I get a $4.00 bottle of plain Biotin at the drugstore? Sure. But she carries the little flat foil packet in her wallet which is convenient. And packaged this way makes them more 'special' in her mind, so she remembers to take them. Unlike her vitamins.",B000FGXMWC,AH2YIROZXTJ7PYOR7NV4LKFVIEBA,2020-08-14 20:31:28.758

5,How much Vitamin C?,I am not impressed or disappointed. The scale constantly changes by 5-6 pounds.

3,"Great for dry, sore skin....","This is what my doctor put me on back in 2006 to treat Candida. I took 5 caps 3 times per day, for quite a while and was on it off and on for five years. It worked very well, until I became resistant to it and it stopped working as well. I have taken other things for it over the past five years and now I am back on this. I will see how it will work for me now.<br /><br />Overall, Colloidal Silver has worked the best for treating Candida. It isn't cheap, but very effective. SF722 is also quite expensive, at the dosage they recommend. There are a lot of Silver Ion products out there, claiming to be Colloidal Silver, so be careful. MesoSilver is a good Colloidal Silver. &#34;Blue Man&#34; was making Silver Ions at home, with salt added to it. Many opinions are that the salt caused him to turn blue.<br /><br />Update 12/1/2015: Working very well. I am only taking this rather than Colloidal Silver for now. My dosage is at 5, twice a day and I am getting good results. I only started at 2, twice a day and slowly increased the dosage. Too much at once, can make you not feel well, as it kills the Candida - Yeast.",B00M8RMP1A,AFGCHEZF76F66HFP2HXF7Y55RUMQ,2015-07-22 16:04:51.000

4,Four Stars,This is a great tasting product that I give to my 24 month old and 8 years old sons. Children need a good amount of omega 3 for brain development and yet the standard American diet lacks omega 3s.

5,The large dial is nice and fairly easy to see but if your looking ...,"The scale shipped promptly and arrived on time with no issues.<br /><br />We've only had it for a week, but so far it seems to work well.  Things I especially like include: (1) the use of standard batteries (included), instead of the more expensive disc style batteries on our previous scale; and (2) the large digital display that lights up (only when in use) to make it easier for those of us with poor vision to read the numbers.<br /><br />In terms of appearance, it has a modern, though elegant design.  We have an older Craftsman style home and try to respect the architecture with our choice of furniture and other furnishings.  While this scale has a modern design, it does not look out of place in our bathroom.",B00VWID4YS,AHZDJACKWCQLCRARSYRLMOAIEACA,2018-07-03 18:09:15.544

4,i think it kind of interacted with other,"I am very unhappy that Airborne decided to discontinue selling Airborne Everyday Immune Support Plus in tablet form. Chewing on this berry flavored tablet reminds me of eating Sweet Tarts. I don't want a vitamin that tastes like a sweet candy. Airborne's slogan is: For those who do not like to swallow pills. Well, from my perspective, Airborne found a way to increase profits. You ask how? Well, the consumer now has to buy double number of tablets. Why? Because you need to take &#34;2&#34; chewable tables versus taking one &#34;1&#34; daily tablet. The prior Airborne Everyday Immune Support Plus bottle contained &#34;60&#34; tablets which was good for 60 days. The new version contains only &#34;50&#34; chewable tablets which is only good for 25 days. Also, I am not sure the new chewable form is giving me the same benefits as the tablet form. I do know the tablet form kept me very healthy.",B017DT4HM2,AGQ7JENQPK4U6H44I227A5RDYLGQ,2014-03-31 22:50:34.000

So many great options with this activity tracker/watch. Things I love about it...<br />1. It lights up with movement of my arm.<br />2. It is super easy to download and use the mobile app with my droid smart phone.<br />3. It doesn't track steps right away, so you get less false readings.<br />4. I can set an alarm to go off at any time of the day and have it vibrate to remind me to take my medications.<br />5. I can set goals for my steps and I can have it remind me to move if I am sitting too long<br />6. It notifies me of when I reach my daily goal!<br />7. I love how easy it is to charge<br />8. Keeps a charge for several days!<br />9. Fits very well and doesn't slide and is not bulky to wear.<br />10. Variety of color band options available to match outfits.<br />11. Easy to read screen, I don't need to find my reading glasses to read it.<br />12. Counts calories burned<br />13. I can use it to find my phone!!!! What!? Amazing! Yes, if my phone can't be found, I can use this tracker to make my phone ring until I find it. I would buy it just for that option alone.<br />14.

2,Good quality,"I deducted one star because this product doesn't dissolve easily. I gave it 4 stars because that may actually be a good thing since that may help with digestive timing. At any rate, I like the idea of a powder... even a slightly gritty one, so I can adjust my intake to suit my needs.<br /><br />UPDATE: I've found that by adding a small amount of this bulk product to Pomegranate, Blueberry, or Black Cherry syrup concentrate will allow it to dissolve quickly. Doing that lets me take the Choline Bitartrate regularly and doing it this way disguises the odd smell of the product.<br /><br />Because of the above discovery, I have changed my rating to 5 stars.<br /><br />EDIT: As pointed out to me in comments, others haven't had the problem with dissolving like I initially had (probably due to the way I was mixing the product with foods) and after only a few changes I haven't experienced that trait anymore. When my current order runs out, I will likely buy this product from this supplier again.",B00VWID4YS,AHC2FO6EMUSLLEH5EENBW3MZ76IA,2016-04-11 02:31:19.000

5,Very nice,"I know that Dana Loesch advertises a beet root product -- and, I thought I might like to try it . . . but didn't want quite as pricy an option.  I've been taking the beet root daily for approximately a month -- and, I DO feel a little livelier.  I'm of the belief that you should give any vitamin/food supplement a 90-day trial before deciding if it is REALLY helpful -- but, I think that this might be an excellent product.  I'll make a final decision in another two months or so . . .",B0096U3VD8,AFJARPV5YVMGNNY6JHQ4UZJL6ACQ,2016-02-28 05:13:42.000

4,Worst taste ever,"The flavor is good and it is easy to get my daily vitamins. Honestly I do not know if there is much of a difference between liquid and pill forms.

I bought a different liquid b12 before I found this one and was so scarred by the disgusting flavor of the other one that I almost didn't buy this one -- but I'm glad I did. The cinnamon flavor is a really nice touch - it even tastes fine at room temperature. I will be buying this brand for years, now that I've discovered it. Don't even bother with the other brands of gross raspberry/cherry/cough-medicine-flavor crap. Just buy this one and you'll be so happy you did!",B0150ZAYOQ,AERTMR7S2KPG2M4SSIUDSLEQBEXQ,2018-03-11 15:06:42.184
5,Five Stars,"I bought this supplement because I want to wean myself off of Gabapentin and because I have RLS I read that this is good for RLS.  The first night I took it, I thought it made it worse. But that was an aberration. It does NOT make it worse, Im just not sure how much it helps yet.<br /><br />I have not really tried using it to replace gabapentin yet. Im mostly just using it about an hour before bed. And it seems to help me fall asleep.<br />Insomnia was another long term issue for me so. I also take Theanine which helps with sleep too. (It also helps take the edge off caffeine. I bought my Theanine from a different, cheaper supplier but the expiration date was too close 11/17. I asked for and got a partial refund from Amazon over the close date. I dont know exactly how long it will take before I run out because I dont know exactly how much I am taking every day. But I do know that anything from Amazon should not have an expiration date within 6 months without disclosing it. My bulk supplements date is April 19 so just under 2 years. I did not ask for a partial refund because 2 years is fine. 6 months is not.<br /><br />I probably would have given the supplement 3 and a half stars and when I give a half star, I explain it because I have to round up or down and then come back later & change it after more time with it.<br />Back to that in a moment....<br /><br />Bulk was nice enough to send me an email offering me 1 free product I presume because I paid full price for the Magnesium.  Thats very nice of them however, I feel like it might tend to overstate the reviews. I appreciate the free product, small and will probably be ordering it again.<br /><br />However, I feel like they are kind of buying positive reviews in a way. Because of that, Im rounding down from 3.5 to 3 but I still plan to come back later and update my review of the product based on a longer time of use. (Ive had it about 10 days now)<br /><br />So I guess I round down a half of a star because I feel like the reviews are sort of bribed in a way.  I feel like reviews should be based on the product itself and I will not give extra stars because of the free 100 grams of a different product. (Dont get me wrong, Im appreciative of the freebie and I may well buy it in the future because of the freebie but I am extra careful not to over-rate the product because of the freebie)<br /><br />I will also not over-rate that product because of it. And I can only wish that others did not/do not.<br /><br />Now, I will come back months from now and update this based on more usage of the product for the reasons I bought it. (weaning myself off Gabapentin is the ultimate goal) And when I tried that in the past, my RLS went crazy so Im not in a hurry to do that again. Although hopefully, this product at higher dosages, MAY help with that.<br /><br />Prior to getting this, I was taking 125mg of Magnesium Oxide every night. (.5 of a 250mg pill) I may or may not start that back because it had a not unwelcome minor laxative effect. But I didnt want to take much higher dosages of that for that reason. With this form, I can try significantly higher amounts without being in the bathroom all the time.<br /><br />So, Im happy with Bulk and Im happy with the product so far but Im not giving the product an extra star because of the freebie.<br /><br />Im also not sure if they give a freebie with every purchase or if it was a one time thing ?",B00GI3S622,AG7MASU6GG6SN7WUCZENVB2XYKIA,2017-05-06 02:40:08.000

Batteries are NOT included, which is unfortunate on its own, but moreover the battery compartment door does not lock properly when batteries are inserted into the compartment.  It's also never a particularly good sign when there are upwards of 10 misspelled/misused words in the instruction booklet.  It's also a smaller diameter scale than others I've used, and the weight measurement itself would appear to be slightly high.

Stand back on, once or twice more, sometimes thrice and you just might get your weight. Or more often, not.<br />But, if you don't like your weight, you can simply move the scale an inch or two, to the left or to the right, forward or backward, play the waiting game again, and ta-da!! You've instantly lost two or maybe three or possibly three and a half pounds. Or your number suddenly goes up - bummer - you've gained two pounds in less than a minute. Worthless.

I am going to continue the full 16 wk suggested use & then see if I need to stay on a maintenance dose. Keep in mind I also have had no sugar except a small amount of Xylitol & Stevia for sweeteners, no gluten at all & the only dairy so far that I've had is Greek yogurt 2-3X a week starting the 4th week of treatment.

Like most people I am also Vitamin D deficient, but to the point I had to mega dose.  I thought this may help me 2 ways by absorbing some D with application and treating my skin problem which was a bad PMLE flare.  When I got it the instructions indicate rotating application site which to me isn't a moisturizer, just a topical supplement that helps soften skin.  I found the softening to be comparable to my usual, cheaper lotions.  It seemed to reduce some redness but not much else.  I will hold off to this winter when my skin flares with psoriasis and see if that helps.  I'm back to vitamin D supplements.",B07C9MYVVP,AGQK5P2SDIGUGM3AWNBNA7KNCDBA,2014-09-27 16:21:34.000

5,Five Stars,Used for my sugar and salt scrubs...a little bit goes a long way!  Great oil!  I was researching and researching fractionated coconut oils and trying to find something not too expensive when I remembered the essential oils I'd purchased from a local health store.  I searched for the NOW brand and viola!  Bought this and the jojoba oil...as well as several of the essential oils of this same brand and I'm very happy with them.,B00L3LC7MY,AGF4XALMSK4A3XU7BCTXPWNCUDDA,2015-05-12 20:13:22.000

5,Good product,"I have used daily for four years Nutribiotic Vitamin C powder products and am confident in their quality.<br />The Hypo-Aller C is buffered and when dissolved in water has a neutral flavor suitable for after meals daily.<br />The Electro-C is effervescent, has a pleasant flavor and is suitable  as a drink before or during exercise as it also<br />contains a small amount of sodium and acts as an electrolyte replacement.  The big problem was that<br />the add advertised 16 ounce bottles and only 8 ounce bottles were sent-requiring asking for a partial<br />refund.",B07QS4TPMW,AFBU67YTDK4GZ2QLGPA5HAT3KCXQ,2012-09-24 19:32:15.000

4,My son loves it!,So I am unsure about this product because of a couple reasons.<br />1. The product looked used. There was a dog hair on the Velcro when I opened it and also the box it came from seemed used.<br />2. The instructions are written in VERY broken English. Refer to the safety warning pics.<br />With those two items it’s hard for me to safely say that it works correctly. I usually have high blood pressure hence the reason for purchasing and it says it was normal. So I’ll update after use.,B07MZMDMRM,AFGKWCYPYPDHK54GWZ3ABEDY46TQ,2019-07-15 04:02:57.938
5,Regular Engergy,"First of all, I really REALLY wanted to like this scale.  It is beautiful and clear with clean lines.  It got good reviews. I was excited, so I ordered it. However, after ONE MONTH, one of the metal rods on the bottom JUST FELL OUT, taking some wires with it. I cannot see a way to repair it. Please note: I am the ONLY person who uses this scale. It is in a safe location where no one can knock into it, move it, I don't have a dog, etc.  It literally fell apart.  UNACCEPTABLE shoddy design.  This is so flimsy and disappointing. My return window closed just a few days ago, so I'm now stuck with a dead piece of glass...",B00OVMK1IE,AFBUSSHN7XOM7GUU23PQBXMMJSEQ,2020-05-14 19:13:06.579

5,A-Ok,"I feel good. I'm under a lot of stress, so I have to focus when working. Before I started taking these the stress didn't allow it. I think they are working.

3,Big numbers and easy to read,"So I purchased this Marine Phytoplankton because I was having dental issues and I wanted to improve  my immunity and overall health. I really don't know how well it is working although I decided to keep taking it until I finished the bottle. After I finished I won't buy it again. But I did make a lot of other dietary changes that have improved my health. I only shop at Whole Foods Market or the Farmers' Markets. I only buy organic food, grass-fed meats (very little), grass-fed butter and I am starting on pasture eggs. I omited all grains except sour dough bread, and no more processed foods or sugar. And I started simmering bone broth. I gave the product a 3 because I think a healthy diet would work just as well. I put the supplement in bone broth and I can hardly taste it (awful taste). They sell seaweed at the Farmers' Market so I am doing more research.  Also, I gargle with sea salt, (regular salt is toxic), use coconut oil for ""pulling"" and  I made toothpaste using the oil, baking soda, and peppermint.  I am glad to say my teeth and gums are looking and feeling much better, and I have lost weight in the process.",B01LMPJG1A,AHYKTLE3IFVTWBIDHTKU44TGZG3Q,2016-11-07 13:21:39.000
3,Contains Carageenan!!,"I am always skeptical on vitamin chews of any sort because they seem to always taste vitamin-y. These chews have been the best so far that I've ever had that did not leave an awful taste in my mouth. They have a nice berry taste and definitely seem to give a boost of energy for me. If anything, it's a great way to get a quick dose of B and C vitamins.",B07VHGX6C7,AEGYAGVIMIZLBPXKYSZ6TBMBVZRQ,2015-10-21 13:20:07.000

5,Four Stars,I have been using this thing about 8 months. It's never accurate. You have to step on it at least 3 or 4 times to get an of estimate of what you weigh. Don't know which would be better but I know this one sucks,B00VWID4YS,AGBGAEYTWZOAN3TMZMRRINRQKGMQ,2021-12-27 19:07:27.844
3,Disappointed,"I started taking this on the advice of my naturopath and it was a surprise to me and her that it cleared my skin of constant breakouts and eczema.  I've rarely been so sure that I could attribute a result so directly to one supplement, but when I ran out of the first 2 month dose and stopped taking it for a couple of weeks, I had skin problems again.  Within a week of starting it again, my skin cleared up.",B017DT4HM2,AG76FBSUUSK6YAZHH3ESV3JGFJUA,2020-05-05 18:08:44.432

2,Easy open lid,"I just received it. I been making Ginger Root Tee for 2 months that is available for purchase in 4 stores. The tea I make has a wonderful aroma and a very light sweet flavor. I do not add sugar, lime juice or honey. I peel the ginger root and I cut it in tiny cubes and I use plenty of it.  I put the ginger in a pot and add 32 ounces of water. When the water begins to boil I time it for 10 minutes. The tea has an enjoyable pungent flavor. The negative part of making your own is that it is difficult to peel the skin off and time consuming. Ginger Root Tea has 12 good things for your body.",B07TLD4CT7,AGD3TUCGQ4KHJJOQL2CREHC4V6TQ,2016-01-20 23:45:49.000

3,It''s so easy for my husband to take,"Omg I can't even take these they taste so bad to me. And smell bad. The few I did take having to choke them down had like tiny tiny hard pieces in them that I couldn't chew. I ended up spitting it out. Made me feel nauseous everytime I did take them. I had to stop taking them yesterday and order a new kind. I'm sure they are fine for some people and the ingredients are good which is why I got them.<br />The softgel is just okay. It's not so soft tho and I had a hard time swallowing it. It's a pretty hard coating compared to other ""soft gel"" pills I've taken.<br />I do love that it has choline in it tho. Even though it's a much smaller dose than I'd prefer and is recommended due to the new data that is out on it. I also wish they had included iron or calcium. Either one would of been fine with me so I didn't need a seperate supplement for each. They shouldn't be taken at the same time anyway so I'm fine taking one or the other at the opposite time of the day.<br />I just wish I could return these for a refund or even partial refund since they aren't cheap and I can't continue to take them so they are going in the trash otherwise. I'd give more stars if I could return them and get all or at least some of my money back since they do seem to be a decent prenatal, but not something I can continue to take when they make me feel like puking. And it's not from morning sickness. I feel fine before taking them, but something just doesn't settle right in my stomach after eating them.",B07SYNTL34,AGC7JA6A5EQSBJ6WCE5ROI24DFXQ,2016-12-19 21:35:50.000

4,Five Stars,"Fast shipping but I repeatedly weighed myself with scale placed on the tile floor and the result was different each time. Up to a 4.5 pound variance. So I returned it because that’s the point of having a scale. Looks nice, though. Fyi the scale shows the current temperature in degrees celcius. You cannot change to Fahrenheit. Odd!",B01M8HNDGK,AFM47WRRFRD5ASQ5OF5VDLJBT5MA,2019-01-21 15:42:20.771

3,Bad batch,Exactly what I was looking for! After you download the app and turn on Bluetooth it saves all of your weights plus tells you a load of other things.

Second time I ordered it the bottle was completely full.<br />I like the ingredients of this product, they are very clean compare to other products on the market. And I really like/trust the founder of the company. I listen to his podcasts on Spotify all the time.<br />However, I have not noticed any major changes in the way I feel after taking it.

2,Disappointed,"I searched for this product because I know for a fact that acerola is the  best source of vitamin C. In Brazil we make juice out of the fruit,  but living in the US I'm not sure where or if I could find it. So when I found those capsules, I didn't hesitate. It's been a month or so that I'm taking it. So far so good. Great immune system boost, easy to swallow no side effects.",B008XIGNIY,AHIKIFEOBTPOPJOS4VPZRG2CC7FA,2020-01-05 02:07:13.785

2,Best replacement chargers I found,Took almost a month to arrive but worth it. Great value for the money. The bands are extremely soft and the colors are bright but still classy.

And so, because phosphatidlylserine has long been at the top of my list, I'm always on the hunt for a bargain. I was delighted to come across the powder form. If you're not adverse to the powder form, instead of the pill, then you'll save tons of money by &quot;cutting out&quot; the filler.<br /><br />In short, this company is pretty much the new Powder City. I've bought several of their products; they all fit the bill.",B01IAIPCG0,AGGDDZWVB6JSDANFWDJHQW24G5PQ,2017-06-10 12:16:03.807

4,Love it,"Especially at night, I have found these tabs to be quite slow to take effect for 'emergency' tabs.  The other night, it took over an hour before my blood sugar started to climb.  Fortunately, I was only moderately low and not dropping quickly, but there have been other nights where I had to get up and raid the kitchen, and then ended up significantly high after these finally kicked in.  That also results in more lost sleep waiting for recovery.  I recommend a more expensive brand that the body can process faster.<br />If you want these, try a smaller pack from the same brand first, just to see how quickly your body absorbs them.  If they work well for you, good for you.",B00FIIJO2O,AH47OVY7W5KAVJE2QD2N22XRDUNA,2020-02-20 05:32:17.918

4,Works amazing,"I bought these because I was informed by a health professional that they are very useful in boosting and maintaining the immune system.  For obvious reasons, we should all be focusing on our immune systems at the present time, so this product is very relevant.  The capsules are very easy to swallow.  I did not experience any nausea, even when taken on an empty stomach and in combination with other vitamins.  I am not sure about how my night vision has been affected yet so I could not rate them a 5 in this area.  I recommend these.

5,Perfect,"This is the first magnesium supplement I've ever tried.<br /><br />I read in the book &#34;Eat Fat, Get Thin&#34; that magnesium glycinate is an excellent supplement for people who suffer anxiety with cramping. Why that's me! I used to suffer from cramps day and night. In fact, I was drinking alcohol every day because it was the only way I could  loosen up the knots. My therapists would all recommend massage and masseuses would work on my knots with horror in their eyes. They would recommend hot stone massages because they couldn't loosen the knot with their hands. The one time we tried it whacking the knot with a hot stone was very helpful. Too bad the cramps came back three days later. For this I pay $200?<br /><br />I do eat lotsa bananas and salt. I do not live on supplements alone.<br /><br />In addition, magnesium will relieve anxiety that comes along with the cramping. Hmm...<br /><br />Note: the glycinate is also excellent because glutathione (the master enzyme that regenerates all your other antioxidant enzymes) requires glycine.<br /><br />How does it taste? Doesn't seem to ruin the taste of mocha smoothies at all. Also, tried it in warm water. Didn't taste too bad but didn't dissolve easily.<br /><br />I tend to take a highly variable amount when I'm starting something. I started off high - about 3-4 gms per day - split into 3 doses. After about 3 days, i noticed my cramping was starting much later in the day. At that point, I raised the amount because it was working and I wanted to check my response. I noticed the magnesium seemed to work quickly once my levels started to pick up. At first, the cramping would ease up, then a few hours later worsen. I used this to adjust my dosage and timing.  Finally, on the fourth or fifth day, the cramping seemed to go away almost entirely and my mood shifted just as the cramps went away. I became almost giggly as I thought of a joke. The mood lasted for about 1/2 a day with me gigging at random intervals. The next day, my muscles relaxed fully and stayed that way all day long! My morning back stiffness from sleeping first eased up, then reduced to small patches of stiffness in my back.<br /><br />Why the odd mood shift? Well, I am bipolar and for my particular genetics, magnesium will make me manic - thus the giggles. Or maybe it was watching that fun pirate movie the night before. I did talk to my therapist and we agreed that was a perfectly normal reaction but monitoring the magnesium is a good precaution.<br /><br />Isn't this dangerous? Somewhat. The danger from mania comes from running 24/7 relentlessly with no time for rest. I've done this for months at a time without any assistance from magnesium.  Cramping 24/7 isn't good either, I almost became alcoholic. It doesn't pay for me to stay on the low side either, the cramps come back quickly. Finally, magnesium is required for production of stress enzymes and with bipolar I need those enzymes in tip-top shape.<br /><br />But the magnesium did snap me out of a low energy funk at the cost of getting the giggles for 1/2 a day. Or maybe the pirates did it. For me, it's a question of walking the tightrope. Carefully.<br /><br />And for everybody else? Eat salty bananas and pace yourself with magnesium until the cramps go away. Waiting 3-4 hours between doses is just about right when zooming in on the correct level. Beats waiting two full weeks for cramp relief.<br /><br />Update: Mysteriously, my thyroid function has improved. My internist is giving me the look of one who has gone crazy because thyroids don't normally do that.  I took a look at the long list of supplements that support the thyroid. The one that changed the most was the magnesium.<br /><br />For those of you interested in improving hypothyroidism the list of supplements is: natural iodine sources, selenium, zinc, B6, B12, iron, copper, magnesium, carnitine, CoQ10, B2, B3, A, C, E, thiamine, high quality protein, potassium, chromium, manganese, omega 3, choline, barley grass or spirulina, B6, B12, folate.<br /><br />Almost every item on the list comes from a multivitamin except magnesium (about 3-5 gms per day when I'm cramping), CoQ10 (200 mg), C (6 gms per day), protein, chromium (1000 mg), omega 3 (12 capsules of the bulksupplements fish oil per day), choline from alpha GPC 50%, and spirulina.<br /><br />Update 7/23/2017<br />Thyroid condition - still in progress but my endocrinologist has cut my thyroid medication. We'll get results in fix weeks time and see how much my thyroid can produce.<br /><br />I spoke with my doctor about the results from the magnesium. As far as I can pin it down, excess magnesium does give me the giggles reliably. In addition to the thyroid improvement (? hard to pin down - too many other supplements), my emotions became much more complex. Seven months ago I was supplementing only with Hardy's Essential Nutrients (a multivitamin formulated for people with brain conditions) and inositol and I was calm. I was calm even in the face of the most outrageous provocation. It was a marvel to everyone that I didn't react negatively and after a lifetime of overly passionate responses a huge relief to me. Now with the magnesium, I feel a range of emotions again including mixed emotions. It's a burden and a relief. I'm irritable again but I've regained my sense of humor. My doctor's level of concern over my nutritional depletion is higher than ever. But we both agree the risk was well worth it. I was almost inhuman before.<br /><br />I'm also on lithium and side effects include random muscular twitching and restless legs syndrome all over my body.  So I would drop things all the time, lose my balance or suddenly accelerate the car.  The twitching and restless legs is greatly reduced or gone away.  This is consistent with medical recommendations to supplement with magnesium to treat tics. I could practically see the gears spinning in my doctor's head when I reported this. Doctors routinely recommend using Ativan (an addictive anxiety medication) to control the restless legs.<br /><br />Magnesium is a laxative. The more bioavailable the gentler. It is hard to OD on magnesium because you'll, errrr..., just lose it. It happened when I went over 5 gm. (The amount you can tolerate will depend on your gut health.) And as the magnesium cleared the system, my giggles went away in minutes.  Once again, it's got to be the gut that is busy using the magnesium to produce the giggles.<br /><br />Now, with bipolar sometimes you get mixed states. These are difficult to treat and last much longer than mania or depression. They also inflict the greatest damage both biologically and socially. I plan to ambush my next mixed state with the magnesium to see if I can break it. My doctor's eyes gleamed when I mentioned this. How we both love a good experiment.<br /><br />So far I've used up about 90 gms of my 100 gm supply getting to this point. Clearly, I was severely depleted (daily muscle cramps that resist massage and other treatment). When I went into this, I was terrified that I would self-induce mania, no idea what I would gain; I had no idea what the therapeutic dose is for bipolar. I wondered if the risk was worth the gain? YES, WELL WORTH THE RISK. When you are depleted, the therapeutic dose is for the birds. Just use your symptoms as a guide. And using my cramping as a guide, no matter how much I OD, two or three days later the cramping starts again.<br /><br />I've never heard of a less scary mania.<br /><br />Finally, my deathbed wish: I want to be hooked up to a magnesium IV. I plan to die laughing.<br /><br />Update: August 13th, 2017<br />It's been at least 3 weeks since I took my last dose of magnesium. The cramping has gone away and stayed away. I seem to experience some rare twitching but it's so mild I'm not really sure. I tucked the magnesium into the freezer, just in case. But so far, my daily multivitamin seems to be able to keep up.<br /><br />I should also report that I experienced brief periods of rapid heartbeat and heart palpitations usually after I ate food while on the magnesium. About two weeks after I stopped the magnesium this went away. This is a known side effect of magnesium. You can either stop or lower the dose. I decided to just keep going until the magnesium deficit went away, then stop.<br /><br />Update Sept 26th, 2017<br /><br />Yes, it is true. My thyroid is producing more thyroid hormone. I've got the blood tests back and the doctors reduced my Synthroid from 75 mcg to 50 mcg.  It looks like the magnesium is the last in a long line of helpful supplements. But the good news is - you can supplement your thyroid and improve function. Of course, the trick is... which supplement is the one you need most?<br /><br />Update Nov. 5, 2017<br /><br />I've been manic for almost two months now and it's definitely been the longest period of cheerful mania I've ever experienced. Every time I slip into that nasty brooding irritation where I can't let go of my problems, I take some magnesium glycinate. It's not even that much about 400 mg for 3-5 days is enough to restore the balance. Normally, I skip the magnesium because my multivite is enough but not when I'm stressed.<br /><br />Tip: If you are experiencing cramping, you may want to consider [[ASIN:B00ENSLW5W BulkSupplements Pure Taurine Powder (250 grams)]] in addition to adding electrolytes. Taurine is a sleep aid, balances your electrolytes, prevents cramping, helps lower blood glucose. It also inhibits excitatory neural pathways in your brain which is why it's a sleep aid AND it will help prevent mania (if you're bipolar). However, if you're depressed, it will depress you even more - DO NOT TAKE TAURINE if you are depressed.  Taurine works quickly (wears off in one day), Take it in the evening after dinner or before bed..<br /><br />Update Nov. 27, 2017<br /><br />I had not mentioned it because the status was so uncertain but the magnesium deficit helped my doctor diagnose a gut infection.  Gut infections are invasive microbes that enter your gut and then somehow manage to destroy the balance of your gut microbiome. Most of the time they are already in your gut but your healthy probiotics keep them in check. Things that can definitely upset the microbiome include antibiotics, proton pump inhibitors (PPI's), illness, massive allergies that inflame the gut  leading to leaky gut, environmental poisons (mercury) and alot more.<br /><br />Bad gut infections (and mine was not good) will strip you of essential nutrients - vitamins, minerals. Finding two or more nutritional deficiencies is the most reliable way to detect a gut infection.  However, conventional doctors don't receive training in diagnosing nutrient deficiencies. How did my doctor diagnose the gut infection? She read about it  - realized I had multiple serious nutritional deficiencies because I kept finding and fixing them AND I was taking Hardy's Essential Nutrients - one of THE most bioavailable multivitamins you can buy. And I was still deficient. She sent me to talk to Hardy's because they specialize in overcoming obstacles to absorbing nutrients.  The Hardy's product specialist  did a great job diagnosing me (it was not easy) and put me on an antibiotic to kill the gut infection. I'm still tapering off the antibiotic but I'm still hunting down vitamin deficiencies but this time - I find symptoms that I used to have. Gone now.<br /><br />The most visible change? My skin tone has changed from an ashy-yellow  to more of a peachy-yellow. People I haven't seen in a while just bust out &#34;You look healthy!&#34;<br /><br />Is it over? Alas, no. Once your gut probiotics go down,  every opportunistic microbe thinks they can take over. It's safer to take probiotics forever than to assume what's left of my gut biome can fight them off.<br /><br />Am I still taking magnesium? Occasionally and only when needed. Since I'm bipolar, the manic episodes generate quite a bit of stress.  I find taking about 250 mg  about an hour before bed is extremely restful and I seem to sleep more peacefully. This works out to a week every 2-3 months. This is on top of the magnesium in the Hardy's Essential Nutrients which has the &#34;optimal&#34; amount. But I'm hoping it will continue to drop as the gut recovers.",B078BX4DLR,AGPUIBLIAEMSSVPN3Z2OTEIG3VXQ,2020-02-06 04:41:48.990

3,Great prodyct,"I first bought this watch for my son back in August 2019. He loved it. It was a good size for him and we all liked having 2 bands to change between. A downside is the app on my phone uses a lot of battery, but I think that's more an issue with my phone versus the app itself!  However, in December 2019, the plastic part that slips inside the band completely broke off while he was just walking around (he didn't bang on it and wasn't playing rough with it on). We were very disappointed but remembered it came with a warranty. I contacted the company (TOOBUR) and heard back within 24 hrs. They were very responsive to the problem and wanted to make it right. They sent us a replacement watch right away. It arrived earlier than expected and amazingly all of this happened just days before Christmas.

2,Stopped working,"This is a review of: Etekcity Blood Pressure Monitor, Upper Arm Rechargeable BP Monitor Machine with LED Display and Speaker...<br />I’m 67 and find myself thinking more about health issues, especially ones that aren’t always noticeable.  I use this regularly, probably 5X a week.  It gives me piece of mind.  It is extremely easy to use.  As long as it has a good charge, it does everything for you.  It even says the BP results out loud.  It keeps a record of your results, so if your BP varies too much from normal, you can take this monitor with you to your doctor for evaluation.  It has the capability of monitoring and keeping a record of two people.  I think this monitor is well worth the price because it will give a more consistent, professional reading than most people when taking their own BP.  Also, the monitors that have the bulb which has to be pumped can be difficult for some seniors to do comfortably because of possible arthritis in the hands and fingers.  In my opinion, knowing and keeping a record of your BP is “Good Medicine”. This review was written by LynKin.",B00B7FQNH6,AHIKJGLXJTBELIOPMVK7U66W7URQ,2017-11-03 23:05:26.792

4,Sticky crap,"Starting in June 2017, I began having very weird and scary symptoms that no doctor could help me figure out. I was exhausted, my muscles ached, my hands and feet were tingling and going number. I was filled with anxiety and depression that was not there exactly one month before. I feared the worst. Long story short... it turns out that if you are already borderline low with B12, getting Nitrous Oxide Gas for a dental procedure 3 times in under 2 months completely drains you of a little known vitamin called b12. I was almost entirely depleted. This stuff was an actual life saver. I was actually so anxious that taking medicines scared me really bad, but this stuff tastes so yummy (like cinnamon) that it was no chore at all to take it. I just pretended it was candy basically. It took about 3 or 4 months--but I was almost entirely cured. I'm pretty sure I have some permanent damage from letting the deficiency go that far (I mean... how could I really know) but I KNOW this helped raise my levels and helped me become the happy, hyper, social person that all my friends and family missed so much. I CANNOT RECOMMEND THIS ENOUGH. And if you have a b12 deficiency, please do not lose faith.

I used it for a week and my skin improved, the lines look softer. I'll probably be getting this in bulk from now on.",B00ZB2JORC,AGRQBCNOOMEQVQWKMW36ORSYB4AA,2021-12-08 02:11:27.753

4,Five Stars,After only two days use of this product my psoriasis have remarkably improved.  I decided to try this cream after reading the reviews and I personally can say they were right.

I have the prenatal ones for that I take because I’m still nursing, so we have our morning routine of taking our vitamins together with our breakfast. I always have to make sure she knows that she can only take one a day! I do have to say that these chewable vitamins may break up a little, I think this happens during shipping, so you end up with dust and bits of the broken star tablets at the bottom of the bottle. And, since they are made from food, they should be consumed before the expiration date because they do start to get a bit soft and crumbly.",B00U371CUW,AF44SVUD2KSNLNC7CUKV63GCDK5Q,2019-11-12 23:21:15.593

The taste of this stuff is outstanding... my very, very picky son wanted more, which of course he had to wait for until the following day.  We take daily doses (1 TBsp for adult; 1 tsp for child).  We take it using a spoon.  I could definitely see adding it to a smoothie, although I have not attempted to do so.  This is an easy and yummy way to add omega 3s into your diet.

5,hopefully I see great results soon,"I don't know if it's going to work or not, but DANG does it taste good! I got it for my kids who were very premature and are hyperactive. I read Omega Fatty Acids help with attention and behavior issues, so I decided to give this a try. I read about how great this tastes (very important when you have two preschoolers) so I decided to give it a try. They weren't kidding! I had to place the bottle up high in my fridge, out of reach from my kids, because my son wanted to drink it like a smoothie. That's how great it tastes.

4,Great product!,"Best ever.  I was a total alcoholic and I would take this vitamin after a night of drinking.  I could really tell a difference.  I could think clearer and my headache was reduced.  This vitamin is supposed to reduce/prevent some of the damage alcohol does to your brain.  If you drink, you need to buy this.  Take one pill before going to bed and one when you wake up and the hangover is cut by 33-50% depending on how much you drinik.  This is the best brand I have tried and I have tried a lot of them.  I am super impressed by this product.",B001KYO2KY,AGHBACWCX6KY5CGWJH5QRGUHTJXA,2021-03-29 09:14:41.274

I have (Asthma and acid Reflux) so I choose to be careful and caution and feel my way with  this and any other herbs alike.  I have notice a cool and calming effect as well as my entire head has itched a lot, ( hair growing in process:) and I do feel more relaxed and at times, yarns when I take it without something , because of my  acid reflux  I eat a small piece of a banana sometimes a few min before to coat my stomach. In this short time of usage, I notice that my acid reflux doesn't bother me much( almost feel non existent)  and am hoping it goes away completely and my immune system get healed and my digestion gets and work much, much better than ever.  Also for my hair to grow , not be gray  anymore, ( except the exceptional gray hairs) and to be extremely vitalized with in the next 2 months (8 weeks), I will update this review at that time, Thank You.",B003XDI3NC,AEXVPMMROCKWAGSFUIV44SEK6ENQ,2016-12-01 23:44:50.000

2,You get what you pay for,"This scale is very wide and always feels comfortable to step on. Not totally impressed with the weight it displays, but perhaps that's something I need to work on. Our kids constantly move it around and the back battery cover has come off 2 times now, it's not a major issue but it seems to be a little loose. If you have the same problem, a piece of black electrical tape will solve the problem.

They appear to be the same as the original that came with my new FitBit and I quickly changed my existing band for one of these new colors.

It has been six weeks and he has decided he would rather take the celery seed capsules than his medication. His blood pressure is a lot better and without the unpleasant side effects he had been complaining about. I am still taking my medication but I've noticed that my readings are much better than they have ever been on the medication alone. In addition, I have had a pain in my side for well over a year that was barely made bearable by Tylenol and ibuprofen. I suspect kidney stones. Anyway, since I started using the celery, the pain initially shifted down and has now gone away.

4,"Great, but bottle could dispense better","Got for daughter’s bday- it looks like a real FitBit Alta! Love that it comes with 2 bands- Black & dark purple. Tracks sleep, calories, steps, activity... very cool & great price. Especially for a kid. Interesting charging port, but I like that it doesn’t have to have a special charging cable, like FitBit does, so you can easily charge it using one of your own USB charging blocks... which pretty much everyone has already.  Battery lasts close to 6 days. Only downside is the app doesn’t have a lot of personalized options on it, but for the price, it’s a great value!

3,Good product.,"This product is wonderful.  Any day I need a little boost, those 10 generous drops in a 1/4 C water, sipped slowly, are a great tonic.  Nothing is a magic pill these days, but this is pretty close.  And this is especially true on those overcast days of Jan. & Feb. in the Northeast.  Use it many mornings.  Just my opinion, may not be the same for all.",B07SYNTL34,AFLRDBSH6Y75W7XI4CMKCXI3772A,2016-09-16 16:33:49.000

4,It seems to help sooth my skin and reduce fine lines. It goes on smoothly and will feel ...,Never had a chance to really use it. Turned it on and it gave me a low battery indicator. Looked at instructions to find the battery I needed and ordered it. Battery arrived and went back to instructions on how to change the battery. I had to remove a very small screw on the back. It looked like a Phillips head. I have two screw drivers that I have used on small screws on my computer. Both of them seemed small enough but neither of them seemed to work. Tried several times. Very frustrating.,B0001IU542,AEMNBHUE6OBENJ5KUXF5EKWEEWCA,2016-03-01 17:55:51.000

5,Five Stars,"Super smooth. Doesn't smell like lavendar and chamomile though, more like mild baby powder, of which I am not a fan. But it's mild, so tolerable.<br /><br />And this is kinda on the manufacturer, and a warning to consumers: This product is not (but should be....) foil or plastic sealed under the cap! If it was, then it would not have leaked everywhere when it melted during shipping. It was literally liquid from being in a mailbox during summer. Of course it firmed up and I cleaned the mess and all's well. But just a pain none the less.<br /><br />Anyhoo, great product.",B017DT4HM2,AHUS6TG7RE64ANNCG23QDTQ7EDVQ,2014-06-18 23:46:17.000
3,Good value,"This actually works. I have tightly coiled hair, so it's hard to tell growth until I straighten it, but I went to a party the other week and my friend comments on how much my hair grew so I straightened it to see and my hair went from shoulder length to almost arm pit length in just a month and a half!

4,"but seem to make things worst, instead of better","It works. It's just constantly changing what it says your weight is and it also tends to measure too far on the heavy side, sometimes by between 5-10 lbs. On top of that, it's a pain to get the batteries into the thing. It's overall more of a hassle and a guessing game than a worthwhile product.",B00F7OZJOQ,AEWL6EL3XL4BDXM55AJC7JWF25HA,2018-06-22 02:42:42.000

4,It's not bad!,"Leaky gut sufferers beware. This helped with Candida, but was devastating for leaky gut. I went on it stopped it, and tried it again 3 months later. Same result: I could tolerate it for a few days, then leaky gut symptoms came on fast and hard.<br /><br />Also, dosing seems a bit crazy. First time I tried it I did 3 tablets 2x daily as what’s recommended. My gut crashed so hard I couldn’t eat for almost a week.<br /><br />My second time trying, I took only one pill once a day in the morning. Still after less than 10 days, leaky gut symptoms became much much worse.<br /><br />This looks like an excellent supplement for many people, but for a subset of us it appears to be quite problematic.",B01A90FMHQ,AHOHMDZHKJ3EYB2H45C7YVTGWILA,2018-08-10 15:09:48.351

5,Too Small for Average Smartphone,"Okay, it tastes horrible. So I put a few drop under the tongue and after a few minutes flush that out with plenty of fresh water or tea.  That's the best way to avoid tasting it. I have been taking it for months for its minerals and other essential nutrients, while at the same time following a balanced plant based diet that includes several other superfoods.  After almost a year, the health benefits are amazing and I plan to continue to include this product in my diet.  I don't know whether it would help for someone on the Standard American Diet (SAD), but I imagine it would at least help some since it is so nutrient rich, and SAD is so nutrient poor.",B07VHGX6C7,AHFCDZUR4CSX3UZYAKLABWDLBETA,2018-06-25 11:42:52.787

4,Terrible build quality,"This is a nice big bottle of full spectrum vitamins without iron.  My functional med doctor asked me to take a full spectrum no iron supplenment in rotation with a chelating agent.  Apparently the chelation grabs onto all nutrients, including toxins and  heavy metals, so replenishing between is essential.  iron is suspect in Alzheimers, so that is why he didn't want iron included.

I've only taken it a week-<br /><br />12/10/14 - I have taken this now for long enough that I have ordered a second bottle. I can tell when I am due to take a dose by my body's reaction- my flare areas start itching. (I had an outbreak of Candida accompanied w/a 1st time psoriasis break out not eczema as previously thought) about 20 min after taking my required dose (5 caps 3x day)the itching subsides. I am going to continue the full 16 wk suggested use & then see if I need to stay on a maintenance dose. Keep in mind I also have had no sugar except a small amount of Xylitol & Stevia for sweeteners, no gluten at all & the only dairy so far that I've had is Greek yogurt 2-3X a week starting the 4th week of treatment.

3,Natural Supplement,"Good stuff.  This is a nice price and on the 20% subscribe and save a good deal.  If you're up on the medical literature there are a lot of folk saying that many Americans aren't getting enough calcium and D and this supplement is a great way to fix that problem.  I have noticed an ASTOUNDING improvement in my immune system since I got my D levels up to about 70.  Very good idea to get your levels checked twice a year as you can get very sick with too much vitamin D, although you normally have to use about 5,000 iu a day to get up to the worrisome levels and this Sundown product provides nowhere near that dose.",B01N2B8SQ1,AFUSH6CNDADLWP5YXBJTDFAMP3YA,2017-03-18 22:21:29

4,Five Stars,"I bought this for my husband as he has swallowing issues & cant handle all the pills taking supplements. We e bought two of these so far. My husband is picky about taste & the product’s taste works for him (sometimes adds to juice).  He doesn’t always tolerate supplements (ie; stomach gets upset) but so far he feels fine taking taking the supplements. There’s a pretty impressive list of vitamins minerals etc in this product. We bought them to help supplement my husband’s deficiencies in his diet as well as to boost his immune system. Can’t say for sure it’s this product BUT since he started taking them 3 mos ago he looks A LOT better and feels a bit different with his overall fatigue, etc.<br />4 stars out of 5 only because there’s really not a definitive way to measure the products efficacy re: my husband’s improvements we’ve seen. But still very pleased customer(s)!",B00454A1HE,AG7Z5GCRCBOQE72ICLWU64TOFCFQ,2016-08-21 14:51:50.000

5,Great Product,"I can't believe I went so long without trying this size of capsule for my supplements! Sometimes, if I'm running low on time, I fill a few by hand they're less densely packed. This product lets me take fewer pills and they fit neatly in my pill case because they're not too long. Once they're snapped together, they form a tight fit and I haven't had any issues with pills popping apart.",B00ZB2JORC,AH3DRI54QK2LUG3XVXXM4YLQGBAQ,2020-12-22 04:43:46.289

5,Excellent buy and a great product,"I use this scale every morning, and every morning I need to step on it at least three times to get a consistent read. The first time I step on it it reads a number that is over my actual weight by 4 lbs, I then need to step on it 1-2 more times to receive an accurate reading. This is nothing more than an annoyance. I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone as there are MANY scales out there that do not have this issue.",B002BQ3EHM,AFYO76JAID44MVECCNPBCHC3J26Q,2017-07-20 23:02:19.227

3,For women who like their vitamins in giant pill form,"I started taking Elebra at the suggestion of a close friend, who gave me a free bottle.  I am a college student with ADHD; I was prescribed daily Vyvanse for 4 years and stopped taking it only a few months before my experience with Elebra began.  Elebra and Vyvanse are in no way the same.  Vyvanse is a pharmaceutical-grade stimulant, while Elebra is a nootropic stack in one pill.  Vyvanse caused me to be extremely enthusiastic and focused for 12 consecutive hours before crashing and having no focus at all.  While Elebra didn't cause similar effects, I did notice a significant improvement to my memory after about a month of use.  I'm not sure which specific substance in Elebra caused this (or if it was a combination), but I don't have the time or money to experiment and deduce the answer.  There have been no noticeable negative effects of Elebra.<br /><br />In short, Elebra is an inexpensive way to reap many benefits of nootropic supplements without having to carefully design your personal stack.",B012CTUT9I,AGRWPUJNDT3OK4Z2EYOPURAFWIHA,2020-03-04 18:18:16.871

4,Love it,I was wondering why I was seeing such a difference in my weight from night to night and just figured it was normal depending on what I ate or didn't eat however then I tried weighing myself multiple times in a row and found that within seconds I could lose or gain 2 pound or more. Tried changing batteries just to see if that changed anything but it didn't. I would not recommend this scale unless you are happy to be within 2 pounds even though it it supposedly accurate to within 2/10.,B00VWID4YS,AHYEJHHQ4RHA6B3GOAAD26HUT2TQ,2019-10-08 15:10:27.348

4,GREAT PRODUCT,"This was recommended to me by a dietician late last year. It's a bit spendy, but much better than buying the fish-oil pills and putting up with fishy burps all day.<br /><br />I like to put my teaspoon's worth in my morning oatmeal, but it tastes good by itself. It may actually taste too good—it's tempting to have an extra spoonful or two, with the result being that a bottle doesn't last as long as it should. But again, it's better than putting up with that fishy taste from fish-oil pills.<br /><br />I recommend not purchasing online, however. My order from Amazon arrived in one of those plastic envelopes with the bubble-wrap lining; this offered next to no protection of the contents. When I opened the package, the cap was cracked, and the seal had been punctured. Fortunately, Whole Foods is just a block away, so I was able to return it with no problem. Now I will only purchase new bottles from the store (whether Whole Foods or other local stores).",B00B7FQNH6,AFGJHUINHYQWTRJMOXZ37UMSE7SA,2014-06-06 15:21:26.000

4,"OMG, JUST HORRIBLE!!!","I have atrophic gastritis. Because of this I cannot break down and absorb B12 efficiently in my digestive tract.<br /><br />This supplement used to be a very nice small lozenge that I could put under my tongue to absorb sublingually - which was perfect because it bypassed my digestive tract and absorbed directly into my bloodstream.<br /><br />But since they have changed the formula and made it into a capsule I can no longer do this. I saw someone suggested opening the capsule and pouring the contents under my tongue, which I actually did try, but found it impractical to have a large amount of powder sitting under my tongue that did not seem to dissolve.<br /><br />Maybe this change was good for some people but IMHO they just eliminated a whole section of the market like myself who have to use B12 supplements which bypass the digestive tract.",B00XA9ZJVI,AELKMQYQEPLTJ4JFYUT64LZMUGDA,2018-06-01 19:10:51.836

5,Five Stars,I really feel good on these vitamins and they give me a lot of energy.  I am in the late 70s and will continue to use these vitamins .  Can you taste the best of any liquid vitamins I have ever tasted.,B00VWID4YS,AH7SS5XJDZXBX6YPCXZM74M26CNA,2013-03-14 19:16:37.000
4,love it,"Taking this twice a day (1 teaspoon per dosage), how are people getting more than a month usage on a 4oz bag?  Did I get a lesser quantity bag?  I only lasted 3 weeks and haven't noticed anything yet... I know with herbs it may take awhile and differs from person to person so I have an open mind.  I'm on the fence on whether I should order another bag especially with such a steep price that only last 3 weeks!",B00NABTNTK,AEOLHDACYC5KZDV4ITNRLHMTYAUQ,2019-02-18 21:48:31.111
4,Great product!,Good price for 10 bands. Colors are attractive and easy to put the garmin in the slot and take out once you have done it a few times. Bands have normal watch buckle versus the gamin's closure. I actually prefer the bands to the one that came with the garmin.,B06XXW2FKQ,AES5QQOMV6667OTIIGMUDN5DMWYQ,2018-03-13 20:39:45.094

3,Looks good and appeared to be well constructed,"I do not in any way mean to discredit the seller or the maker of this product, there are other reviews on here that indicate that people had better experiences all around and I don't doubt that at all.  My wife & I noticed that on Amazon it says 1/2 to 1 teaspoon serving size, but on the product it says 1 to 2 teaspoons serving size, I would stick with the first - just note this.  I suffer from severe psoriasis it started 23 years ago and has become much worse over time.  I ditched my injections over a year ago with Covid fears and suppressing my natural immune system and have tried unsuccessfully to control it through diet and whatnot so I found myself trying out this product in hopes of any relief, so today the product arrived on time : )  I immediately got started and took a glass of warm water and dissolved 2 teaspoons of powder into water. First sip was extremely unpleasant,  I knew right there I would never be able to drink it, so I grabbed a second glass added honey and sugar to water and added maybe 25 percent of original glass into now deluded batch and swigged it down.  I felt like I swallowed gasoline, but managed to do this one more time adding another 1/4 of original glass to a new sweetened glass of water. Very very horrible I knew I could do another, this would be equivalent to 1 teaspoon down in two glasses of water. Then I emptied a gel pill I had and filled it with the powder and swallowed it down and called it good.  About an hour later I puked my guts out, was not from lingering taste it just forced it's way back up, also noticed I had a weird headache on half my brain not as painful as a regular headache, but more sickening like I felt poisoned like a rat or something?  The sick feeling in my stomach lasted from 2:00 - 7:00 but the gross headache lasted until about 8:30 or so but still feels strange dizzy kind of feeling.  If you can believe it my wife stills wants to keep it for herself,  but I am advising her to take no more than 1/16 or less of a teaspoon at a time.  I know some people actually take notes of some things in tinctures meaning cut it 100 times and cut it again - this stuff is strong and I believe small amounts should have results, but for me I am not taking any more for the rest of my life : )  I hope you have better luck Lord knows we all need it.",B001HX3APQ,AE6Q7S3DFF5B26YTG7O3LY6ZYP5A,2019-07-31 03:51:14.791
5,Some spilled out in shipping,"It is a waste of Money.  In the first charge I was amazed how long it stay charged, but I didn't like how long I would wait for it to wake up and check the clock. After 4-5 days the device wouldn't pair with my Android. After a couple hours it paired. Last night I charged it again and now it's completely dead. No water, no bruises or anything. It's a brand new device and after one week it's broken. I don't understand how many people write amazing reviews about this product here on Amazon's and lead others to buy.",B01LTCKG7Y,AHRIW5YTVP7W3WSS3ZPD3OYXVY3Q,2020-03-09 00:16:07.679

2,I love that it does not have the molecule caynide in ...,"Starting in June 2017, I began having very weird and scary symptoms that no doctor could help me figure out. I was exhausted, my muscles ached, my hands and feet were tingling and going number. I was filled with anxiety and depression that was not there exactly one month before. I feared the worst. Long story short... it turns out that if you are already borderline low with B12, getting Nitrous Oxide Gas for a dental procedure 3 times in under 2 months completely drains you of a little known vitamin called b12. I was almost entirely depleted. This stuff was an actual life saver. I was actually so anxious that taking medicines scared me really bad, but this stuff tastes so yummy (like cinnamon) that it was no chore at all to take it. I just pretended it was candy basically. It took about 3 or 4 months--but I was almost entirely cured. I'm pretty sure I have some permanent damage from letting the deficiency go that far (I mean... how could I really know) but I KNOW this helped raise my levels and helped me become the happy, hyper, social person that all my friends and family missed so much. I CANNOT RECOMMEND THIS ENOUGH. And if you have a b12 deficiency, please do not lose faith. Someday, you'll be able to stay awake the whole... you'll be able to go for a walk again... you'll be able to live!",B00VWID4YS,AFHSZVIPUPMVGUGPGSTA3JB3NCYQ,2020-01-01 05:17:57.711

This product, which cost $24.99 for 150 gummies, was delivered with all 150 gummies mushed together. I have had this happen once in awhile w other gummies, a few here and there. But this seemed like the bottle was extremely overheated at some point. I could not get any gummies oout without using a sharp knife. From the top down to the middle (haven’t finished to the end yet ). I am not sure that the potency is ok. I would think not. Things happen. I’m most annoyed that the vendor did not even respond to me when I wrote to him. I can no longer reach him/her through any other way than this honest review. My recommendation? Do not buy anything from this vendor.",B00HSGSCCC,AFPM67PYOOTTHZCVAYMIB3HUQT6Q,2014-07-22 15:58:47.000

1,Best taste,"I started taking Elebra at the suggestion of a close friend, who gave me a free bottle.  I am a college student with ADHD; I was prescribed daily Vyvanse for 4 years and stopped taking it only a few months before my experience with Elebra began.  Elebra and Vyvanse are in no way the same.  Vyvanse is a pharmaceutical-grade stimulant, while Elebra is a nootropic stack in one pill.  Vyvanse caused me to be extremely enthusiastic and focused for 12 consecutive hours before crashing and having no focus at all.  While Elebra didn't cause similar effects, I did notice a significant improvement to my memory after about a month of use.  I'm not sure which specific substance in Elebra caused this (or if it was a combination), but I don't have the time or money to experiment and deduce the answer.  There have been no noticeable negative effects of Elebra.<br /><br />In short, Elebra is an inexpensive way to reap many benefits of nootropic supplements without having to carefully design your personal stack.",B00J4Y8DES,AE3XZVXAXT5P5KOF4IS6LH4IC4FQ,2016-08-21 14:51:50.000

3,Best Chewable C out there,I was happy it had no taste but when I put the full dosage into my daughters bottle it would make her spit up a few hours later.

4,I love this stuff,"I bought it because I started the Niacin fad to lower my tri-glycerides. It works reasonably well for that. But beware: it bumps up your blood glucose by 15-20%. Always tell your doctor if you are taking Niacin or they might think you have become diabetic/pre-diabetic. The blood glucose comes back to normal once you stop the Niacin.<br /><br />As an aside, you can drop a little of the Niacin powder on the food or drink of someone you don't like. They will have the 'flushing reaction' and they'll think they are having a heart attack and call for EMS.😜 (Don't recommend this. Also have good home-owners/umbrella insurance if you try this).",B07FKFC7KJ,AEIPI37UIY62A442FZUXWFMO22YQ,2020-05-26 15:12:11.892

2,Five Stars,"Finally!  I am a freak of nature and cannot tolerate most supplements - they make me wheeze like an accordion in the hands of a three year old.  But without magnesium I turn into a pretzel from all the cramping and despite paying big bucks for a famous name magnesium supplement I still have issues.  I've only been using this a few days and hubby and I already have stopped with morning muscle cramps.  I make a daily drink of 1 quart water, 2 T Organic apple cider vinegar, 2 T organic lime juice, 1/4 tsp Bulk Supplements Pure Magnesium Glycinate Powder, 1 tsp sea salt, and a sprinkle of stevia.  Shake well and sip all day.  Yummy and I am finally absorbing the mg I need.  Will increase to 1/2 tsp next week but so far no gastro problems (and I would absolutely have those if this product caused them).  Very happy indeed.  Will be trying the CoQ10 powder soon.  P.S.  I simply transferred it to a glass jar for storage.  Much easier to use this way.",B002BQ3EHM,AHK3RJ3JCC2MCGISANK47RQ66ISQ,2018-03-13 20:42:50.646

3,"Might make you hot, red, and itchy","This brand of Marine Phytoplankton says it's Oceans Alive and probably is made from their Marine Phytoplankton, but it's been diluted to half strength and that's why it costs less, so you have to take twice as much to get the same result which winds up costing you more. I recommend buying the Oceans Alive brand which is an excellent product that will do much to improve your quality of life.<br /><br />Since writing this I've discovered Pond Grown Marine Phytoplankton Powder which is both much cheaper and more potent. Just don't buy the cheapest, you tend to get what you pay for. I suspect the cheapest (by Sunfood, again) of being cut with Chlorella (a fine product in its own right, but not up to the level of Marine Phytoplankton).",B017DT4HM2,AGROWJ5MXV7E2OBEMTOUVOQ3G42A,2020-09-16 18:48:24.412
3,Great product!!,I discovered the value of taking celery seed extract some years ago has a way of reducing night time cramping . I usually take two a day and that keeps cramps at bay nine 99% of the time .<br /><br />I had used Swanson products for better than a decade and always find them to be top quality . At purchase many of them through Amazon because I can get them a lot quicker than I would ordering from Swanson .

It made my coffee look like it was curdled. I drank a little of it anyway. It tasted horrible! I then went and looked to see if it was expired, nope. Then read the 1 star reviews. Apparently this form is not meant for human consumption?! I have problems with my kidneys to begin with and I have a very limited budget. Now I feel like I've been duped by this company and have wasted $ and have to throw out 500 grams of this junk! Why is it still being sold?!

After taking these supplements along with daily use of Minoxidil the hair on top of my head now blends in perfectly with the hair at the sides and has almost total coverage back. I was lucky to have caught my hair loss in the early stages. It took around 3 months of continuous use before my hair reached it's peak volume again, so be patient with these - I take one tablet in the morning with breakfast and one at night before bed.

My diet has been very spartan with no sugar or gluten, while still not eating meat or dairy, as we are vegans ( I've had the bad Candida issue for 45 years, since a teenager on lots of antibiotics and a terrible diet of meat, dairy and sugars (I did not even eat vegetables then)).",B06XXW2FKQ,AHI4OHH3IGNSUVSWAJ5CWMIGO67Q,2020-02-12 03:12:54.114
3,Not realy calming. and very havy cream.,This product works well. I like how quickly it reads the temperature. Our old under arm thermometer would take at least 30-45 seconds and holding a sick young child still while it took the temp was a hassle.

3,Choline helps your liver.,Nothing moisturizes like petroleum jelly. Pay a fortune for weird animal fluids and la-de-da perfumes and STILL you won't get the same results.

2,Great taste easy to take!,I was told by Dr to try using for migraines. I have C3-C6 fused in front of neck and C4-T2 fused in back of neck. After the last fusion in back I continued to get migraines at least 2-3x a week. I also have severe back and neck problems since. I take 1 tablet a day 7 days a week. I only get migraines about 3x a month sometimes I get lucky and don't get any. This is much better than before. I would suggest for migraine relief or help. This brand is expensive but well worth it since I've tried cheaper brands at a higher dose and less success. I did research before buying and glad I bought it. Definitely will continue to use and would rather use this than regular dose of prescription meds.,B07QMXBNXR,AECF3K35ZGF3XU3W5SP3U4D7IYQA,2016-03-13 03:10:18.000

3,Slow melt,"I was looking for a magnesium supplement that was easily absorbed but without the laxative effects that other forms can cause. I've tried magnesium citrate in the past and while it doesn't bother me, other family members have had a different experience.<br /><br />Magnesium glycinate is supposed to be much less likely to cause digestive issues than citrate. BulkSupplements had a good price on the bulk powder so I thought I'd order some and see for myself. The good news is that we've have no issues at all with it.<br /><br />If you plan to put the powder into gel caps, note that it isn't very dense which makes it harder to pack. In fact, after making a month's worth of caps, I've decided that the raw powder doesn't taste too bad after all.<br /><br />This product is definitely worth a try if you need a good magnesium supplement without the laxative effects of magnesium citrate.",B002VLZ8C6,AE45B64AYHS5YLIWSHPBBP4SHULQ,2015-01-07 19:03:11.000

5,Great bottle for cream and lotion to be used in,"Remains to be seen if it seems to work or not, but it’s clear that the product is unappetizing - very oily feel and taste, but the smell is sickeningly artificial strawberry or something and lingers on things like cups so that you have to smell and taste it again later. Also, causes me to burp, which is rare, so I have the added bonus of having to deal with that for a little while later.",B00O8W7NVU,AEMIQC4I266XBLHUMVEYL7TEOS6Q,2020-05-31 08:19:26.775

4,No power,"I must say that when I first heard about this product I was extremely skeptical. I am a college student, and although I'm ashamed to admit it, I have used prescription ADD medications in the past to help me focus and give me the energy to complete large assignments. I began looking for an over the counter supplement that would give me similar concentration and energy, which led me to elebra. I have been taking these pills for a week now and I am very satisfied with the results.<br /><br />I have been taking elebra for five days and have felt results every time. Although it is recommended that you take three capsules, I only take two. I took three once and felt sick (nausea and a headache, due to me being a small person with an extremely low tolerance to all substances). With two capsules, however, I feel an almost instantaneous boost of energy and concentration. I took two pills this morning, after hours of laying around my house staring at my to-do list with no drive to do anything on it, and within twenty minutes time I felt focused enough to attack my first task. Even when you're feeling lazy, elebra gives you the perfect boost of energy that you feel that you might as well do something productive with it! I've even taken these pills before a night out with friends to increase my energy and social engagement. Works like a charm.<br /><br />Of course, the results are not as profound as prescription ADD medications, but if you're looking for something natural and over the counter to give you just enough energy to get through the day, this really works.",B003PRICN2,AEBXMAXZ4EFGHUXQ3VGLD5XSZVUA,2017-11-08 22:24:57.240

3,TINY,"I had been using a very good lemon fish oil that had a great taste, but was still oily on the tongue, so I mixed it in smoothies. I can take this right from the bottle! I don't care for fish at all and eat very little meat, so this vegan style was great for me. And although it lacks the vitamin content of fish oil and the laxative effect, it has More Omega !

4,Great Product!,"I started using these from when I was getting my Masters degree and knew I'd be staying up all night.  I had tried other herbal supplements but they gave me the shakes and made it hard for me to concentrate. But these ( very specifically the YELLOW package) keep me awake...that's it. No jitters, no headaches or dizziness. Each pkg  comes with three tablets, so if you're not used to taking herbal supplements with energy enhancers I would suggest just taking one and seeing how it affects you. I do take three, but I can also drink a Diet Coke and take two Excedrin and still sleep through the night.  While I don't think they are addictive, I wouldn't get in the habit of taking them every day. I take them when I need them very most. Sometimes it's just a couple of times a month.

2,Very good product.,"The Focused Mind Jr ones work, these didn't. My youngest son has had trouble with focus, only focus; not behavior or hyperactivity. The easy melts worked but he gagged at the taste. I had to melt them down and put in his OJ and then his drink at lunch and he still detected it. So I bought these capsules. These have little no no effect what so ever. I have no idea the Focused Mind Jr. Easy melt chewable ones work and this doesn't. It has to have different ingredients. Ok I just looked it up and it does have different formulas. One has Inositol (that was the Jr that worked) and the other has Cognizin. The 10+ Focused Mind did nothing for my son.",B0009VO8EO,AFYASK6UKQFCKYHE7ZQ2VIJNBYXQ,2021-02-09 00:22:39.333

2,"Good stuff. Now out of stock, of course.","I bought this one to replace a 40 dollar scale which I had used for a few weeks but decided to return. This cheaper one was the way to go! I like the app that goes with the scale, you can easily set up different users and so I got my whole family set up in a jiffy. I can’t speak too much to the accuracy, as none of us have had our body fat percentage measured with calipers recently. However, it seems more or less correct based on our body types.",B07SYNTL34,AHRA35DREMGZPLQHSEKTT7NPV6CQ,2020-10-28 22:27:01.110
2,I love this product,"I just ordered any old thermometer but learned that they have different features.

4,My husband us it every day,"I had never heard of this flour before- if I ever find it affordably priced- I'll be buying a ton of it! I will not be buying it again for the amount received from this brand-its a joke!<br /><br />Aside from the obvious cons of expense and amount---I absolutely love the flavor, aroma, texture and baking characteristics of this flour-it adds a special taste that NOBODY can pin down! Its like having an mystery spice in your recipe that doesn't overpower or undermine other flavors in your baked goods.<br /><br />I am really disappointed in the amount-this canister is 1/2 full and I maybe got 3&1/4 cups out of it-thats like over $5.50 a cup! holy cow!. So I really was unable to use this flour in the range of recipes I had hoped to sample.<br /><br />This flour would likely make some amazing crepes or dessert tortillas-but I can't really say---It was gone by my third recipe (and thats in conjunction with other flours).<br /><br />It performed really well in my banana bread, pie crust and blueberry muffins-I used it in conjunction with white rice flour for a gluten free solution. I wish I would have reserved this flour for recipes with fewer competing flavors so I could appreciate this flour more.<br /><br />all in all- everyone should try this type of flour in their baking-its amazing-but expect a very small and expensive amount from this brand. If anyone finds a better source for this-let me know!",B00VWID4YS,AEFMN3GKBHYUHSXLNMK6DF4KVK2A,2019-04-14 13:10:23.185
5,Good tracking watch for kids,Have tried other brands of Magnesium Glycinate to help with sleep. Wanted to try this product because the price was more reasonable.

4,Wack,"I have atrophic gastritis. Because of this I cannot break down and absorb B12 efficiently in my digestive tract.<br /><br />This supplement used to be a very nice small lozenge that I could put under my tongue to absorb sublingually - which was perfect because it bypassed my digestive tract and absorbed directly into my bloodstream.<br /><br />But since they have changed the formula and made it into a capsule I can no longer do this. I saw someone suggested opening the capsule and pouring the contents under my tongue, which I actually did try, but found it impractical to have a large amount of powder sitting under my tongue that did not seem to dissolve.<br /><br />Maybe this change was good for some people but IMHO they just eliminated a whole section of the market like myself who have to use B12 supplements which bypass the digestive tract.",B01A90FMHQ,AEA7VB4L5LFMADOAY75C7SAQGXHQ,2020-07-28 21:00:13.413

5,Good product,Scale always starts on KG so every time we use it we have to press the button on the bottom to switch to LB.  Then if you even bump the scale when sitting it back down the scale switches back to KG.  Basically the scale has to be sit down super softly to avoid resetting to KG.,B077BQ13ZV,AGDMWBZESVLBAYMJJZLCVDVIDRQQ,2018-02-10 11:48:03.345

1,Fast and accurate,"We bought one for our 10 year old last Christmas. It worked great for about 8 or 9 months and then the battery stopped charging.

I liked this scale so I moved it to the bathroom and I can get my balance using the towel long before my weight is calculated. I like the looks of this scale and the numbers are big enough to read standing up, plus the scale holds the weight number a few seconds after you step off. I tested for accuracy by weighing myself 3x in a row and each time was the same. I'm loving this scale. It's a keeper!",B00Q0VHJJI,AFRBQMCEFFVW2Q7KHDNDY2ZWWBGQ,2016-03-04 19:16:56.000

2,Worst product I have bought on Amazon,"This is the second time I've bought one of these because my daughter took the last one I had, she loved it so much! So many great options with this activity tracker/watch. Things I love about it...<br />1. It lights up with movement of my arm.<br />2. It is super easy to download and use the mobile app with my droid smart phone.<br />3. It doesn't track steps right away, so you get less false readings.<br />4. I can set an alarm to go off at any time of the day and have it vibrate to remind me to take my medications.<br />5. I can set goals for my steps and I can have it remind me to move if I am sitting too long<br />6. It notifies me of when I reach my daily goal!<br />7. I love how easy it is to charge<br />8. Keeps a charge for several days!<br />9. Fits very well and doesn't slide and is not bulky to wear.<br />10. Variety of color band options available to match outfits.<br />11. Easy to read screen, I don't need to find my reading glasses to read it.<br />12. Counts calories burned<br />13. I can use it to find my phone!!!! What!? Amazing! Yes, if my phone can't be found, I can use this tracker to make my phone ring until I find it. I would buy it just for that option alone.<br />14.

4,Amazon has the products that I am looking for.,"I have done three years of major gut healing and repair but I still seem to require magnesium at times to have a morning BM. I was using citrate, but that form is less than ideal for longer term use. This form is better.<br /><br />I love the reasonable prices of Bulk Supplements. And taking powder mixed in water is pretty much the best way to absorb (got that tidbit from Dirty Genes by Dr. Ben Lynch - a great read!)<br /><br />The citrate form from this source was so chalky - not nice and fizzy like Calm (which I avoid because apparently it has high arsenic and this brand doesn't) but this stuff is just foul to choke down before bed. Gag! But worth it.",B00F7OZJOQ,AFKTDNW4SNMF6MOAVHSJA6DVKHMQ,2016-03-22 05:12:45.000
4,more energy?,"This product definitely was a brain stimulant for me. I took a capsule at 5am and was wide awake way past midnight. I was hoping for relaxation. Everyone is different so it may be what you need. I've read reviews where it helps with sleep. The capsules are small and easy to swallow. No jittery feeling, just kept me awake way too much... the product was fresh and ships fast :)",B07SYNTL34,AEKDA2IDGWLBHD73RSTIEXVOT5TA,2014-03-11 09:34:13
3,Raised my vitamin D level to normal range in 6 months or less,"It does help hair grow back in. It may take 6-8 weeks for you to realize it, but Appearex Biotin does help.

3,Bathroom scale that is only a bathroom scale.,"I wanted an affordable fitness tracker, and this one is well worth the money.  I have since bought one for a relative too, who also loves it.

4,#1 TOP RATED UBIQUINOL,"Convenient. Does not taste bad at all.  Easier than chewing or taking pills.  You can add this to anything and it will not change the taste.  I have used it in my morning oatmeal, lunch soup, or several  teas. I've even used it under my tongue.  It's not bitter at all.",B072C63Q3S,AETPUOBB3PQUFTTB5QGWNCHOW44Q,2017-06-27 03:27:18.793
3,Glad I found it,"This scale worked great for the first few days. After about a week it stopped working. Everytime you stepped on it it said there was an error. Now it doesn’t turn on when you step on it. It only turns on when you push the back reset button. However, even when it turns on with the reset it stays at 0.0 and never weighs anything.",B000JWK4DM,AGRDISK2T5X6YCYUKRIPIPOVH5FQ,2019-12-09 21:56:06.486

5,Disappointed,"After reading the book, &#34;The Magnesium Miracle&#34; by Carolyn Dean, I learned the importance of magnesium to the body and that most people don't get enough in their diet. I'm in excellent health, but who wouldn't want more energy, and a clearer mind! I also learned that the magnesium oxide I have taken for decades doesn't do much for you as it is poorly absorbed by the body. I did my research and found that this is a good form of magnesium. I have found this to be a great product. It mixes well into a small glass of water or other beverage and is easy to take as it doesn't have much of a taste. I am very pleased with my purchase.",B07S44T2YD,AFEP6XXCTLKMZL5KYPSJPVGQGOKA,2010-08-15 13:41:54.000

4,Great product for the cost,"I bought this scale from Yoobure at the end of December 2020 (so, a year and two and a half months); and, it's already defective.  About a month ago, the readings already started being inaccurate; and this week, it keeps displaying the ""oL"" symbol (for overload, even though I'm barely 190 lbs).  From the other true reviews on here, this seems to be a pattern for this product.<br />I've written to the manufacturer to see where I can get this fixed, and they suggested that I try fresh new batteries (which I had already, and the problem persists).  They offered me a 20% discount coupon to get a new one, since they only cover the scale for up to one year.  Seems highly convenient to cover a product for only one year when it breaks down right after the one year mark.<br />My previous glass scale lasted over eight years...so, I would highly recommend you not buying this one from Yoobure.",B07MZMDMRM,AETZZGV4J74IOCBVNQX2MUY7HX3Q,2019-09-29 21:47:17.685

4,Four Stars,"I didn't think it mattered where I got this. However, the consistency of this is underwhelming.

4,Five Stars,"I got this for a very specific use case. I started wearing earplugs at night, which meant setting a typical alarm clock would not cut it. This works exactly as I’d hoped. I put it on before I go to bed. I open the app and set the alarm time. Make sure it’s synced with the watch before you close the app! Then I sleep soundly knowing that it will vibrate on my wrist when it’s time to get up. It’s a much more pleasant way to be awakened than an alarm clock, too!<br /><br />As far as sleep tracking, it does that too, but I’m not using it for that. It also tracks your steps but I don’t use it for that either.",B00EIS9NTY,AHZTB3N2BUTFZMPWAVFQ2L3NF7TA,2023-03-13 17:47:05.957

4,Awesome product!!,The price was too much and the ounces too few.<br /><br />It was easy for my son to take without any fuss.

5,Good,"I've found this cream before in stores but couldn't this time. Amazon to the rescue.  I needed it for a DIY cream recipe. It's one I got from the internet and wanted to try. This cream is rich and loaded with vitamin E which is great for your skin, especially any scarring. The smell is stronger than normal body lotions but I knew that already. It's so rich and moisturizing. This formula was for anywhere you need it including your face. It as follows: (written by a doctor) 6 ounces of any petroleum jelly, 16 ounces of Johnsons Baby Lotion, 4 ounces of vitamin E cream. You put in a bowl or 6 cup glass measuring cup and blend/whip it together very well. Put it back into your same containers or use new ones. It's very thick and luxurious giving immediate moisture to soothe dry skin.",B07M5X9BWL,AHKZ25CLFS2DA6ASSF6GZWTE2TEA,2019-12-27 22:02:36.074

4,Five Stars,"I've been doing a lot of research on D-Aspartic acid and thought I'd give it a shot.  After using up the entire container, here's what I noticed:<br /><br />1.  It's very acidic tasting.  I guess hence the name. I mixed a scoop in with my morning protein shake.  Even with adding Flaxseed oil to my shake, I still taste the acidity. It's not terrible by any means....just gives your shake a different taste.<br /><br />2.  I've never been a heavy sweater in my lifetime, but I think this has changed me.  My work outs now leave me completely drenched, although my effort in the workout hasn't really changed.  I also seem really hot throughout the day too.

Well, I do not know if they have helped my thyroid yet, but these have actually ended up replacing my TUMS completely.  I did not even realize how wonderful dulse is at neutralizing acid.

They immediately refunded my purchase price and shipped me a new scale. The new scale was easier to set up and pair with my phone. It is currently working. I have raised my review to 3 stars. After 45 days if the scale is still working as expected then I will again edit my review and raise to 5 stars based on the excellent customer service I received.<br /><br />The scale has now been working for 45 days and I am both pleased with the product and the customer service I received.,B000JFBD5W,AFWNXACSH4ESBSDXWBI4O7CYUULA,2019-09-11 02:06:01.154

The first time I used it - no matter what kind of floor surface I used (all were very flat)  the scale is off by over 50 pounds.  Same weight each time, always over 50 pounds off.  I have zero'ed it out, and tried other adjustments.  All to no avail.<br /><br />Can't return it as I don't have the original packing any longer.<br /><br />Piece of junk.<br /><br />I loved everything it was stated as being -  it just doesn't return a valid weight.",B077VWTHLX,AEW2XTYXE33PQFLUFH52IO4SPWBA,2014-08-16 19:30:29.000

4,It's have help very much of my concentration,"I must say that when I first heard about this product I was extremely skeptical. I am a college student, and although I'm ashamed to admit it, I have used prescription ADD medications in the past to help me focus and give me the energy to complete large assignments. I began looking for an over the counter supplement that would give me similar concentration and energy, which led me to elebra. I have been taking these pills for a week now and I am very satisfied with the results.<br /><br />I have been taking elebra for five days and have felt results every time. Although it is recommended that you take three capsules, I only take two. I took three once and felt sick (nausea and a headache, due to me being a small person with an extremely low tolerance to all substances). With two capsules, however, I feel an almost instantaneous boost of energy and concentration. I took two pills this morning, after hours of laying around my house staring at my to-do list with no drive to do anything on it, and within twenty minutes time I felt focused enough to attack my first task. Even when you're feeling lazy, elebra gives you the perfect boost of energy that you feel that you might as well do something productive with it! I've even taken these pills before a night out with friends to increase my energy and social engagement. Works like a charm.<br /><br />Of course, the results are not as profound as prescription ADD medications, but if you're looking for something natural and over the counter to give you just enough energy to get through the day, this really works.",B0096U3VD8,AEHIVCFK6IFTYNVZZOHVT7KTPYHQ,2020-08-30 02:48:02.552

5,This stuff is great. A few of the other reviews mentioned a ...,"Bought this based off reviews and I was disappointed once I started using it. The design is nice and looks great, but the function is terrible. I put my hands on my knees when I’m sitting and sometimes I bounce my knee (nervous habit) and it was counting steps when I did that. I could shake my hands in the air (like waving) and it would count steps. I’ve owned Fitbits and Garmins and those didn’t do this. I ended up just putting this away because I didn’t feel like sending it back. Spend the extra money to get a Garmin or Fitbit.

This is a great product - the gel smothes in to your skin easily, and goes to work right away. It truly does heal. Don't confuse this gel with the Fruit of the Earth Vitamin E skin care cream that you can find at Walmart.

4,FeedBack,The Taste is so bad however this is the way you do it. Fill a glass 1/4 clean water (duh). See through glass. Get a wooden flat stick and keep pounding it in stirring until dissolved -- that is a thick Pasty dissolved formula. Plug nose or do not breath. Swish it around plug your nose do not smell or taste it take a big Swig and swallow it. Keep rinsing and swallowing...take a big glass of water keep continue rinsing your mouth until you get it down but do not breathe or taste anything yet. Then take a piece of gum strawberry flavored or strong Wintergreen flavored. Swish it around your mouth do not breathe that and keep the gum in your mouth and slowly start to breathe. This works.<br />😣😌😐😊,B003PRICN2,AE6QYMCBFTRYVW2LXPIWLA77EQHQ,2021-09-23 12:26:25.219

3,Exactly what it states,"As a fitness tracker, this watch is about useless. I walk about a half mile to work every day, and occasionally walk another half mile to lunch. Other than that, I don't really walk. I can also use my phone's gps to know how far I've walked in a day (never more than 2 miles... ever). This fitness tracker consistently reports me as walking 4-5 miles regularly. I have no idea where it's getting this from.<br /><br />The step tracking seems to be reasonably accurate when you're actually walking -- within 15%, probably. The problem is all kinds of things that aren't walking register as steps. I've been using this for a week, and each time I get to work, I check how many steps it reports... usually about 1200 for the trip, which seems reasonable. Then, mysteriously, I'll gain another 1000 during the day until lunch, and then another 1000 before I leave. In the morning at home I usually accumulate another 800, and somehow in the evenings, I nearly always pass 9000.<br /><br />Here are some things I know it reports as steps, from my own tests:<br />1) Brushing your teeth. Spend a couple minutes brushing every morning? It'll log 4-500 steps for this.<br />2) Chopping vegetables and other things while cooking.<br />3) Bouncing my daughter in my arms to get her to calm down.<br />4) Bouncing my leg at my desk (inconsistently).<br /><br />Now, all of these things are physical activity of a sort,  but the calories burned and distance traveled metrics are based on the assumption that steps are steps, which these obviously aren't. Plus, even with these known factors, there are still many steps that appear from sources I am unaware of.<br /><br />So, what can this watch do? Vibrate as an alarm... but you have to set the times in the app, and the interface isn't great (it's not bad, either, just not optimized for setting alarms). One customer asked if you can set an alarm for ""every two hours"", and someone answered yes. You cannot. I mean, you can set an alarm for 10:00, and another for 12:00, etc... but you can't set one alarm to go off every two hours. Also, the alarm stops vibrating when it detects that you've woken up, but since it also is terrible at detecting when you are asleep, it frequently (most of the time) stops vibrating when I'm still asleep. I have gotten around this by setting three alarms, a minute apart.<br /><br />The battery life is pretty good. It lasted 5 days. But, its very inconsistent. The watch arrived with like 89%, and by Friday, it was at 54%. Then, suddenly, Saturday evening it vibrated and warned me about a low battery... open the app and it's at 11%.<br /><br />So, avoid this watch if you want anything related to fitness. Probably avoid this watch as an alarm system unless you really can't spend more than $20.",B003PRICN2,AESYCNK6SZ5YLQ3FQJSGTOH2BMMQ,2019-01-12 23:43:55.226

Even if I sync every morning when I wake up, and every night before bed (obviously not counting nights I charge it).<br /><br />Seems to hold a battery charge around 4 days for me. Takes just a few hours to fully charge.<br /><br />I set my weekly alarms and that feature works great. Might be nice for the vibration to be just a TAD stronger for the alarms, as I have slept through a few (thankfully I still set my phone alarm those nights).<br /><br />All the alerts work for me, calls/text/sedentary/etc.<br /><br />Is waterproof. I don't take it off when I shower, when I bathe the kids, etc. However, I DO take it off when I do dishes/swim/etc. I don't want to chance it with full submersion for long periods of time.",B001KYO2KY,AELQ7C6DACCR3HFS4WVKKJPFRSWQ,2022-06-06 21:11:32.871

4,Great Product!!,"Literally crap. We have been using this thermometer we bought for like $3 at a grocery store for YEARS. Very unreliable, so I figured it's time to get serious and purchase a real thermometer. All the positive reviews persuaded me to give this product a try. Ugh, so disappointed.<br /><br />We followed the instructions to a T (wife is a big reader on instructions, and she's the one that opened it up). Yet, our temperatures are never consistent. I know that our temperature is likely to vary from time to time, but what we got each time was just ridiculous. The majority of the time, I was only 93 degrees. What the heck. I really don't think that's true. We would measure about 4-5 times in a row, in the same spot, just to see if maybe it was like a false reading. Nope. All 5 measurements would be completely different. I would be 93.4, 97.7, 95.4, 98.3, and 96.5. What kind of thermometer is this? Even the cheap one we got from the grocery store was at least always consistent in the readings - like if I was 97.6, then I would be 97.6 when I measured again back-to-back.<br /><br />I was sick with a terrible cold for a week, and I felt like I had a fever during some of the days. Obviously no temperature confirmation, thanks to this crappy thermometer. According to the thermometer, I was only 93 degrees despite the feverish forehead and chills. Right.<br /><br />Literal piece of trash. I'm hoping we can return this because it's completely useless.

How any supplier would think that I would finish all FOUR HUNDRED in less than 10 months is beyond me.  I called Amazon right after receiving them & was refunded the full amount I paid for it.  So I figured why not, just take what I can until they expire, since I didn't technically pay for them anyway right?  WELL I couldn't because the gel caps on BOTH bottles were sitting around for so long that its just one big ball of melted gel caps. I attached a picture.

4,Only worked for a few days,We got these for one of our kids whose Garmin Vívofit Jr band was just a bit too snug. So far they work great. I was surprised how soft the bands feel. Softer than the original. It is easy to switch the Garmin between the bands but they do fit very securely. All 4 of my kids have used them now for their Vívofit Jr bands just to try them out and have liked them also. Colors look just like the picture. I was very pleased with this purchase.,B078SBDGGB,AF3L3LFFCBVUOZMAOVFISGBMY2MA,2019-07-12 00:54:10.650

I had no side effects from it.. you got to keep taking it this was my 1st bottle , time will tell it it's just like what l got from my Derm. Dr. But half the price.. this product is great for the skin & precanerious lessions . It looks big but l can swallow it. But it has a score mark to break it in half.. also half the price of my Drs pill.. same exact thing . I checked with her 1st.. & got the high five for buying it cheaper for myself..",B006FQC6P0,AEFL3ZVL4RFQ3ILQR3UTACZQLVIQ,2019-02-18 18:29:30.698

4,Five Stars,"Finally!  I am a freak of nature and cannot tolerate most supplements - they make me wheeze like an accordion in the hands of a three year old.  But without magnesium I turn into a pretzel from all the cramping and despite paying big bucks for a famous name magnesium supplement I still have issues.  I've only been using this a few days and hubby and I already have stopped with morning muscle cramps.  I make a daily drink of 1 quart water, 2 T Organic apple cider vinegar, 2 T organic lime juice, 1/4 tsp Bulk Supplements Pure Magnesium Glycinate Powder, 1 tsp sea salt, and a sprinkle of stevia.  Shake well and sip all day.  Yummy and I am finally absorbing the mg I need.  Will increase to 1/2 tsp next week but so far no gastro problems (and I would absolutely have those if this product caused them).  Very happy indeed.  Will be trying the CoQ10 powder soon.  P.S.  I simply transferred it to a glass jar for storage.  Much easier to use this way.",B0009VO8EO,AG324XF3KIIDWWMRABLWDMYORO4A,2021-03-28 17:23:45.119

4,Great Product!,"I bought these after they were recommended on a yeast management message board. I would not recommend them. I saw no difference in my condition while taking these supplements. The mysterious name probably should have been a clue... I've read that a lot of people swear by these, but maybe they just don't work for me.

We don't have Chinese restaurants like that in our town anymore, but a taste of this kidney fortifier tea brings it all back to me.

The first one I ordered was for my boyfriend, and it smelled very fishy, but we definitely felt the amazing cognitive effects when we took it together.<br /><br />The second batch had absolutely no fishy odor what-so-ever, which prompted me to call the company thinking that it wasn't choline bitartrate, but something else. They were very understanding, and allowed me to return it, refunded me, and STILL sent another one, free of charge. They went above and beyond, which definitely helped me have a lot of faith in their company.<br /><br />The new batch that came in still did not have that overwhelming fishy odor that I was expecting (or any at all, for that matter).  The fishy smell may be an indication of reduced amines. Needless to say, I took it anyways. I combine it with inositol, to get the max benefit. I can't really tell much of a difference between the second batch and the first, but so far, so good. I might put it in a GCMS (I have a friend that has access to it and can tell me if it's pure), but for now, I feel like I can sit and concentrate for long periods of time on something and get it done. I'm also calmer than usual.<br /><br />I'll update this in the future, and keep you guys posted on how effective this stuff is. It'll be a while before I can get a third batch, but until then, it looks like I'll be using this stuff for now. I'm hoping it is choline bitartrate.<br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Update* 3/20/15<br />This is my FOURTH BATCH of Choline Bitartrate, and so far I've noticed that the quality/purity of the product has been declining. I am NOT feeling the same effects that I used to with this new batch. Even though I noticed from the onset that the texture was completely different---as if it was &#34;overcooked&#34;--I'm hoping bulk supplements can rectify the problem. Their quality control needs to be worked on--this is VERY disappointing, and dangerous. I will try to contact the company on Monday, and also order a smaller batch to see if quality is any different.<br /><br />I will make an update very soon. I will also change my rating back to 5 stars if I see some significant improvement in the quality of this product. Sorry bulksupplements, but you guys are faltering in this regard. I purchase regularly from you guys---I'm hoping this will be resolved.<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />UPDATE 8/16/2015:<br />So it appears that bulksupplements has changed the name of their product to the more precise chemical name. This could explain why the choline has a different effect on me now. It's got its pro's and cons:<br />Pro's<br />---I'm not as emotional as I was with the older batch<br />---It not longer causes constipation (that was a big problem for me and others I know that use it)<br />---Mixes better and completely dissolves<br /><br />Con's<br />---Can cause dysentery, and really bad diarrhea if you take more. I use more because of my condition, and now i have to taper it off some, which is somewhat of a problem for me. but so it goes.<br />---Makes me a lot more dehydrated because of the above<br /><br />Overall, it's not  too bad. Choline bitartrate should smell fishy, as to why the one's I get don't is something I'm going to try to find out.For now, I'll continue using the product since there is more good that comes from it than anything else. The company is fair, and I their inositol that I use is of the highest quality. I hope they use another synthesis process to produce the choline bitartrate, but for now, this will do.",B078P4V2CD,AGLXUT43SPAHQHIDNW7HVLVREPBA,2015-08-26 17:34:27.000

3,Purpose was to help my sister keep from getting sick so often and it is working,"This is super moisturizing cream, that is absorbed quickly and doesn't irritate my sensitive skin. I use it as a general moisturizer for my hands and face. It leaves my skin feeling really soft and healthy looking. The effects seem to last for quite a while and the longer you use it the better the results, I have found.<br /><br />I first came across this cream when looking for something to cure my dad's eczema on his hands. The tips of his fingers had long deep splits in them and were incredibly painful for him. I happened across someone who advised using this propolis cream in conjunction with the Forever Living Aloe Vera juice [[ASIN:B00137JS3O Forever Aloe Vera Gel, 33.8 oz]]. You drink an 'egg cup' (about 2 tablespoons) twice a day and rub on the propolis cream. This cleared up my dad's eczema within a few days. Way more effective than the doctor's steroid creams. Later on, when his eczema came back, we tried just the cream on its own. It did work - but not as quickly or as effectively as doing the drink and the cream together. In the past we have also tried other brands of aloe vera cream and drinks - but they have not been as effective - so on this product I am brand loyal. After a couple of rounds of this, my dad's eczema disappeared completely and has never returned. Many years later, he experienced very dry skin on the palms of his hands as a side effect to taking some medication. The skin was literally peeling off in big sections. Once again, the doctor prescribed steroid cream that had no effect. He went back to the propolis cream and aloe vera drink and again within a few days his condition cleared up.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this cream generally and in combination with the Forever Living aloe vera  drink for anyone with eczema or other skin conditions.",B008RQODJ8,AEOWB5DJSHB3TY3IIQ54U76MUD7Q,2018-01-20 12:16:14.201

4,it is a pretty piece of jewelry,"My doctor recommend that I get on vitamin d, as I was on a journey towards getting pregent. I brushed the whole pill swallowing thing. And hen I saw these. I am soooo happy I did. I read all the reviews and ordered two bottles. They tastes tasteless. And I started to feel a sense of calmness not my usual tired self.

5,Allergic to it,"Super smooth. Doesn't smell like lavendar and chamomile though, more like mild baby powder, of which I am not a fan. But it's mild, so tolerable.<br /><br />And this is kinda on the manufacturer, and a warning to consumers: This product is not (but should be....) foil or plastic sealed under the cap! If it was, then it would not have leaked everywhere when it melted during shipping. It was literally liquid from being in a mailbox during summer. Of course it firmed up and I cleaned the mess and all's well. But just a pain none the less.<br /><br />Anyhoo, great product.",B00B7FQNH6,AE5EGHQGUB4MXFUE5ZQDCN7QBSPQ,2016-11-28 05:19:19.000

5,Two Stars,"The D3 Liquid drops are great.<br />I got the K2 liquid drops at the same time as the D3 Liquid. I was impressed with the K2 flavor, and wanted to wait before rating the D3 Liquid drops just to be sure...<br /><br />Well, I'm sure!<br />The D3 Liquid drops by this brand tastes great. In fact it has very little taste and if you drip it directly onto your tongue, you have to take note and focus so you can feel them hit your tongue since the taste is so slight.<br /><br />I do like the drops versus the pills, as I just detest taking pills every day, and this brand makes it so I don't mind taking it every day.<br /><br />So, a solid 5 Star on the D3 Liquid drops, just like the K2 drops I have.",B018WN1SLQ,AE3LBRFY6VK4TMC546ULYAQWWCSA,2019-01-30 20:57:55.718

5,NOW never disappoints,"Bought this for my 8.5 yr old son as he had been asking for a fitbit with a watch.  Benefits of this - charges really easily, stays on during all his sports, waterproof, price, style.<br />Cons: the mobile app isn't completely user friendly - it could use some user experience help.  The accuracy of the sleep tracking could also better.  Our son is usually asleep by 8:30/9pm, but the app says he isn't asleep until 11 at the earliest.  Our device settings also show the correct time zone. The step counter also seems very sensitive as he gets steps by riding in a car.<br /><br />Over all - this is a great option for kids to track activity (accuracy ok) and have a watch.  I have the mobile app on my phone as my son does not have one.  We did not connect it to receive the calls/text messages so I cannot review that piece.",B01MRHCA09,AFGNXQZLRPQIT4PNAKVHDPLCE7KQ,2018-08-23 17:22:04.862

5,5 stars,"I have noticed that many companies on Amazon are selling the same device under different names, I guess they are all alike. Most<br />likely they are all made by some Chineese factory, just branded differently. Generally speaking, this is very basic device, no touch screen, no nothing, one button to navigate through menue settings. This device also has extremely strange charging option, probably the worst one I’ve seen. Regardless of anything, this is decent product for the money, relatively accurate, fairly simple to use (both device and application), and I definitely recommend one.",B001HX3APQ,AHWRSN6VHXWUYQPPEKZHA6F7KXXA,2017-04-06 19:17:06.000

5,Don’t buy this one....,"Totally disappointing. While it is programable, and sadly i weighed in at 265 this scale fluctuates up to 20 pounds on me and does not provide an accurate reading. Perhaps I exceed the weight limit. It makes me wonder if the additional stats provided are anywhere close accurate or not. I've been on a serious diet working on trying to improve and this scale still says the same numbers and varies 20 pounds on the regular. Works great for my wife. Its a shame to have paid over $50 on a scale that in ineffective for larger users. I'd not buy this again if you are heavy like me .",B07CW639YG,AGNQO5OR3MO5J3MWCPPWX5CLUEMQ,2021-10-01 17:42:46.857

I can manage the tablespoon a day without gagging.  The taste itself is fine.  I don't really like the texture.

4,Five Stars,"I don't often write reviews, but I like this product a LOT, so thought I'd share my experience. I'm 30 years old, male, 160 pounds and have used lots of caffeine/energy products over the years. Coffee, energy drinks, tobacco, you name it and I've tried it. For studying for SATs to studying for finals in college to studying for professional exams, and now working very long corporate hours. On a bad day I'll probably go through 5+ cups of coffee.<br /><br />So when I saw the company's reason for creating Elebra - ""we often had the energy but not the concentration to put it to good use"" - it was an easy sell. I'm assuming they meant focus to go with all the caffeine. Exactly what I was looking for.<br /><br />I took 4 capsules (3 is the full-serving size) the first time, figuring I probably consume more caffeine than normal - and was not overly excited about the results. I went back to my trusted coffee, but thinking it might've been my high caffeine tolerance, I decided to give Elebra another shot and took a couple of Elebra along with the coffee, remembering another reviewer recommended this. It was night and day vs. taking Elebra by itself. It's a noticeably different feeling when taking coffee + Elebra vs. either coffee or Elebra by itself. The nice part is I can get away with taking just 2 at a time. Highly recommended!",B071CZ69SR,AET35LDDYSC3NHO56TXQHPZK6ORQ,2018-02-28 10:01:49.809

I ordered this one after going through a lot of reviews and searches because I've been neglecting my health and it's taking a toll on me physically. I feel tired, exhausted, constant headaches, dry skin, and just a whole list of more. The first couple days I took this, I immediately feel a little more energy and physically better. I've only been taking one capsule a day, and I'm feeling much better since. Sleeping better, eating better. It definitely helps, but of course you have to complement it with a good daily schedule and balanced diet.",B000FGXMWC,AHMWON5E5ANT6DY7LFFQMZFWB7EQ,2019-07-04 17:16:44.915

3,Seems to be working so far,Taking multivitamins in pill form makes me extremely nauseous. (I have a weak stomach) The liquid Wellesse vitamins does not cause any nausea at all.

3,GREAT TASTE BUT ARTIFICIAL INGREDIENTS ARE NOT NEEDED/WANTED!!,"Vitamin B12 is important and most multivitamins have around 10% of the daily amount.  However, most of it is not absorbed.  This product is absolved into your system fast and completely.  In 3 days, I have noticed a big difference in my energy level.  I also make sure that take it early in my day so the energy is used up by bedtime.  The dropper in my bottle does not hold the liquid in the dropper so I have to lean over the sink.  Also, it has a strong cinnamon taste, but does absorb fast.",B00B7FQNH6,AHBRHJN4ZOYOC7ZJ2ZZT2STBRWWQ,2015-03-31 20:41:13.000
3,Two Stars,This product was perfect for getting the high dose of vitamin D my Dr. prescribed. It is tasteless and the bottle includes a dropper for easily controlling the amount dispensed.

I took this product for several months, while staying clear (as much as I can in these stressful times) of sugar, flour and other sources of glucose, then took good quality probiotics (at least 12-13 strains), sweated in a sauna or tub for 30 minutes several times per week, and voila!

2,It's working.,I usually purchase the Nordic omega 3 gummys that come in the box. I purchased these and they're 5 times the size of the other gummies and have less mgs of omega 3 making it 100 times harder to get my kid to eat then. Idk what I was thinking when I ordered these. Also they have these salt like granulars on them I guess to prevent them from sticking to eachother but my 7 year old does not care for,B00TYQ7IBK,AGPAXVLELK72U4USTT4LJ2JSG47Q,2019-06-11 16:59:31.695

5,"INGREDIENTS LIST PICTURED IS OUT OF DATE - NOT THE ""SAME GREAT WORKING FORMULA""","I bought this and threw it in my medicine bin for my next psoriasis outbreak. I had been using a different brand and was unhappy that they discontinued it. At the same time, I developed pre-hypertension. I was keeping an eye on my blood pressure and nothing really was helping. I was on the meds, drinking hibiscus tea, exercising, cutting out salt and sugar...if you have it you know the drill.<br /><br />Then my skin started acting up and I started on this cream. I used it for about a week and over that time, my BP started to drop and drop and drop. I didn't make the connection at first and then found a video explaining how Vitamin D deficiency can raise blood pressure and how Magnesium can help as well. I think this cream is helping me with my blood pressure as well as my psoriasis.<br /><br />So, yeah. 5 stars.

5,Five Stars,"Pros: once absorbed, your skin feels great, generally it works<br />Cons:  takes a long time to absorb, heavy perfume smell<br /><br />I have used Fruit of the Earth Aloe Vera and there is no fragrance in that product.  I simply did not expect any fragrance in this product at all and for me, that is a huge disappointment.<br /><br />It takes longer to absorb into my skin than I expect, so my first impression was that it felt mildly sticky.  Once absorbed, though, my skin is left feeling soft and healthy. The downside of course is that it made my but smell like aftershave.  I would never put this product on my face because of the perfume<br /><br />A fresh or neutral scent would be fine, but this is spicy: in the realm of aftershave, furniture polish...motel cleaning products?

Sometimes it varied by as much as 4 pounds. Tried it on various hard surfaces with the same results. I wouldn't mind if the reading was off by a pound or two so long as it was giving a consistent reading, but the fact that the number changed every time makes the results meaningless.

I mix it half and half with apricot kernel oil (along with essential oils for scent) and use it after showering.  The combination absorbs quickly.

5,It doesn't actually count your steps.,I like that I only need to give my baby one drop. She does a good job taking it. It is sometimes hard for me to give her just one drop since the bottle doesn't come with an eye dropper and drips easily once the flow starts.

I’ve tried many different brands of vitamin and so far this is the best vitamin c I had. It’s a bit big considering for the high dosage of Vitamin C it has but I don’t have trouble swallowing it. If you want to boost your immune system and have some health issues like allergies, this extra-strength vitamin c is the best for you.

The normal reference range is 20-50 ng/ml, so I'm well within the normal range. Nonetheless, I had hoped for a more significant jump in vitamin D levels, towards the highest &#34;normal&#34; value.

4,Great,I take this at night to unwind from the day and pair it with passion flower from the same company. Mild taste even in water and no alcohol.

I take it, feel I’m tired and achey for a few hours and then it passes and I feel better than I did before I took it.<br /><br />Some people have mentioned constipation as a result of taking this. When you kill mold in the body it makes you constipated. I find that taking a couple capsules of oxy-poweder, which is “ozonated magnesium”, with dinner each night relieves this completely and makes sure my body is able to continue eliminating the toxins created my the dying mold/yeast/candida. It’s really important for your mood to make sure your system stays regular so that the toxins can keep moving out of you.",B00ZB2JORC,AEXGWIDZ4YROSAIVBGN62CHH5SIQ,2020-02-29 14:25:11.752

4,Works like a dream.  Doesn't disrupt the stomach.,"Milk flow max definitely saved my breastfeeding relationship. I had a late-latcher (8weeks before he had his first full meal latched) I was pumping, and supplementing with formula, trying to keep one of those nipple shields on while baby thrashed his head around from frustration, and to top it all off he was 10lbs when he was born! So he was a HUNGRY-HUNGRY-little-Hippo! My supply was suffering, id cry every night feeling like my milk was going to dry up. I wanted to breastfeed in the worst way! I finally got him to latch at 8weeks!!!!! (Woot woot!) but there was never enough for him to have a complete feeding. I started milkflow once a day for about a week and saw an improvement!! :) then after a week I started taking it twice a day. I'm happy to report we are down to only one bottle of formula right before nap time, and all the rest is soley breastmilk straight from the tap :) I'm not gonna tell you it doubled my milk overnight, lots of water and proper diet along with this supplement does tho! there is a bit of an after taste (especially if you burp a few mins after taking it) but it's a small price to pay for something that works! :)<br />good luck out there mama's you're doing a great job!",B00VWID4YS,AEJXD2EUGKJNIMITT2DHFC6ULWMA,2019-04-08 14:59:07.763

I use it on my face instead of a moisturizer every day after showering (at least in Fall thru Spring... in Summer I use aloe without Vitamin E because the E oil can be slightly too oily in hot weather).

5,"Great product, not a gimmick","I started taking this so I could get a better night's sleep. It's been about 5 days now and I have not noticed a significant difference. Maybe that's not long enough. I do feel a little more relaxed after taking the supplement and I feel like it helps me fall asleep easier, but as far as staying asleep and the quality of my sleep, I do not feel an improvement. Plus it tastes horrible! The best method I found for taking it is mixing it into a small amount of water, make sure it dissolves, and quickly gulp it down. I need to take magnesium supplement, so I will continue taking it and hope that my sleep improves.",B07NQ55D5Y,AHABHXRB65XQVV2EA2QFEYIII46A,2015-11-30 21:15:04

I took several temperatures on different family members and they all registered as 94 or 95 degrees, after turning the thermometer on and off several times in an attempt to &#34;reset&#34; it.

And maybe it is just my imagination, but my kidneys feel better (I don't notice them in my back anymore).  I'm not getting up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom either.

4,Great taste,"I use Magnesium as part of an electrolyte replacement mix. I had been using Mg-Citrate, which has a slightly “sour” and effervescent flavor, however can be upsetting to some peoples’ gut.

5,Great alternative to Fish oil,This product is helping me to release excess yeast and so far seems very potent. A lot of customers are leaving poor reviews saying the expiration date is from 2019 but that is actually the date it was manufactured (MFG) so the sticker expiration date is correct. I contacted Thorne directly to ask about whether or not to take with food. They said at first it's best taken with some food such as crackers (Not exactly on the candida diet but whatevs) in the beginning until your body adjusts to the supplement. You don't necessarily have to take it with a meal but that may be a good approach when introducing the undecylenic acid.

The other supplement made my skin smoother, less wrinkled, it was amazing. I knew it was working because everyone I saw asked me what i use on my skin?

4,Good product,"I ordered this thermometer for my wife, who very clearly had a high fever. She was sweating and was very hot to the touch. When the thermometer arrived I read the instructions and followed them accordingly. I first cleaned the thermometer with some hand sanitizer, wiped it off with a damp paper towel, turned it on so it came to the normal temperature had a flashing F in the right hand corner and said Lo. She put it under her tongue to the back right. When it beeped saying it was ready, it read 96.2. I had her redo it a few times thinking maybe she had done something wrong. She very visibly had a fever as she was sweating and looked awful. Every time she tried it it read in the 96 range. I cleaned it off and tried it myself with pretty much the same reading. (mine got up to 97). I followed the instructions even further and had her breath out of her nose for a minute with her mouth closed, and not eat/drink anything, then put it under her tongue. Unfortunately to no avail. Her's got a little higher to 97 but clearly not accurate as she certainly had a fever.<br /><br />Too bad I can't return this item and now wasted 10 bucks and will have to buy a better and more accurate one.

5,Energy,"I received this with a 7/2024 expiration date.<br /><br />Other reviews mentioned this didn't taste amazing,  so I tried it.  Got sick that night.<br /><br />The next morning I started looking through other reviews and found several mentioning that lot with that expiry may be bad.  Sure enough when I poured the bottle into a measuring cup there were clumps of mold and who knows what else.<br /><br />Disgusting.  Never will recommend.",B017DT4HM2,AF7RDVYTIZI2DGH7TA2AGZF42KBA,2021-02-19 21:19:05.856
4,Inconsistent. Buyer beware.,"This is one of the best probiotics on the markets. Source naturals has low prices and high quality products. Great to send candida packing.

4,I bought this thermometer in late December 2016 and the ...,Being my husband has a very sensitive stomach he cant take a lot of pills/vitamins without messing his stomach so was not getting nutrients I know he was needing.

5,"The product is good however,",My sister told me about this.  I figured it would have a weird taste to it and was shocked to discover how delightful the flavor is.  Reminds me of a Starburst candy or a creamy popsicle.  My whole family likes it including our six year old.

3,No me duro 15 día no sirve,"I was excited to try this supplement because of all the great reviews.  I’ve struggled with candida for years and was hoping this would provide some relief. Unfortunately after taking just ONE capsule, I experienced horrible heartburn that lasted several hours.  I did some research into why this would happen, and apparently it’s suggested by nutritionists that this supplement be taken along with Betaine Hcl for proper digestion, which the company failed to mention.  Obviously the reviewers who popped 5 capsules with no side effects have plenty of stomach acid to properly digest them.  Apparently I’m not one of those people.  In fact, this unfortunate Incident did lead me to the conclusion that I must have low stomach acid.  So I went out and purchased some betaine Hcl and my heartburn is gone.  So I suppose I paid $42 for a learning experience.  But now I have 249 capsules sitting in the cupboard since the company doesn’t offer refunds.",B01A90FMHQ,AEFKR6OVJ2B4UQKVY2U2MIK2R5KQ,2021-03-01 23:16:35.092

It’s baby soft!  I do not recommend it for daily use as it is a big greasy and I can’t imagine wearing make up over it.

4,Not long lasting,My husband loves this silicone medical alert bracelet. He gets compliments on it all the time. Nurses and lab techs are always asking him where he got it. I ordered it for him because he bruises so easily due to his heart condition and meds. The metal bracelets always caused bruising but the silicone strap doesn't. It also doesn't get caught in the hair on his wrist.,B01MT9ZLH1,AHZD45UOGTXGSH2XT4235ZBDRMBA,2015-11-04 21:54:04.000

2,Three Stars,"I actually bought this for my son who is struggling with remembering to use the bathroom. For some bizarre reason it's very hard to find a kid's waterproof watch that has vibrating alarms at reasonable price.<br /><br />I didn't want him walking around with a toilet on his wrist (really?), have some dumb watch that broke the second he washed his hands, something that beeped annoyingly, or spend $50. This shouldn't be hard.<br /><br />I was able to set this up in a few minutes with alarms set every 2 hours to remind my son to take a break. I believe this has up to 10 alarms.<br /><br />He of course also thinks the fitness tracking is a fun new game.<br /><br />Now he has a slim little watch that he can wear all day and be discreetly reminded while in class and can actually wash his hands without ruining it!",B017DT4HM2,AEFJ2PNS6KCSN45VXKHB4AVA4PAQ,2017-02-01 15:40:25.000

5,Easy setup,I felt a definite boost that lasted the entire day from the very first dose i took . No stomach upset. Flavor is fine for me; I don't find it horribly unpleasant.  This replaced my daily routine of taking 8 separate vitamin pills (one was a multi) that didn't provide benefits that I could feel. Tropical Oasis is actually supplying what I was looking for in a daily dose of vitamins---increased energy and a feeling of well-being.

I'm of the belief that you should give any vitamin/food supplement a 90-day trial before deciding if it is REALLY helpful -- but, I think that this might be an excellent product.

3,"A++++++ product Amazing,for kids who are picky","So, I had been looking for specifically Blue Spirulina for a while now, and everyone I had seen use it ALL recommended Blue Majik. When I looked it up, I was a little taken back by the cost compared to the amount and decided to keep looking. I tried a couple other products but nothing was really giving me the color I was looking for. I decided to give this a try, and I am sorry I didn't try it sooner. It was absolutely perfect. Beautiful color, no harsh smell, easily mixed into everything. Wonderful product.",B01B710W2G,AE3D6GJMTLK4NCP377AXNBXD77KA,2016-10-13 12:49:26.000

1,Not accurate and doesn’t work,"It's been already a  month since I started to take this supplement and I see  positive results. I ordered it for my nails as they are thin, and of course wanted to grow my hair longer. I haven't seen much changes with my nails yet  but my hair looks fuller , more healthy and shinier.

5,Five Stars,"I gave this product a shot only to replace my using cooking coconut oil. The cooking style turns solid when cold. Place in hand and begins to melt...sort of. This is a much easier way to put coconut oil on my diabetic dry legs and feet. This works much better then ANY lotion on the market......I have tried almost all of them to only have additives cause other skin irrigations, like itching. This coconut oil does not make me itich and dryness improved in 2 days of use.<br />Highly recommend to fellow diabetic sufferers or other people suffering with dry skin.

4,Good quality,"Been using this product for a few months as I have terrible cramps in my legs, that seem to be triggered by a medication I take. Magnesium didn’t seem to be helping much. My doctor recommended that I try Nicotinamide as an option for potentially lessening the severity & frequency of the cramps. After a month of taking this product my leg cramps were greatly reduced (from several per day & night, to 1-2 per week), the severity was no better at first unfortunately. But after 4 months the severity decreased greatly & frequency went to 2-3 times per month, taking just one 500mg capsule each morning. And now after 6 months at this dosage I have gone a month without one. This helped me so much!",B072NZB8H5,AG4T6R7BV6RW6C6PZGDDIOI6EX7A,2017-08-12 03:30:25.110
4,Do What the Doc Says,"A decent upper arm Blood Pressure cuff that seems to be fairly accurate.<br /><br />Setting up the WBP202 was really easy. The cuff can be used with or without the BP Tracker App. My wife has an iPhone SE and I had no problem installing, registering, and using the App. Unfortunately, the App requires an account to use and has no standalone option. After setting up your account you have to verify your email before you can actually sign in and use the App. The App has a simple and nice interface. It can track BP readings for two users and is completely customizable for each user. In order for the reading to register from the cuff to the BP Tracker App you have to start the measurement from within the App.  The BP Tracker App finds the cuff with no intervention required other than making sure Bluetooth is enabled on your phone and the cuff is on. The iOS version of BP Tracker requires iOS 8 or later. The user manual has a link to the Android App but the site is to the manufacturer's Chinese website that even when translated it hard to navigate. Wear Care has a U.S. website but I couldn't find the Android App on their website. BP Tracker is available from Google Play. It says it requires Android 4.3 or above and only works with phones. I couldn't get it to install on my Android 4.4.1 tablet.<br /><br />The WBP202 itself is well made for the most part but has some minor drawbacks. The Start/Stop button is on the side of the cuff which makes it a little difficult to position on your arm without accidentally pressing it and starting a measurement. It takes some getting used to but you need to grab the monitor from the top when positioning the cuff despite a natural inclination to grab it from the side. There is no way to turn the cuff on without invoking cuff inflation and a reading. You have to turn it on and then press Stop really quick to stop it. If you don't stop it quick enough it registers a triple 0 reading (SYS, DIA, PR). The cuff will record readings for two users and retains historical data. When looking at historical data it scrolls between User 1 and User 2 so you can't just look at historical data for a specific user. I guess this is where the App comes. The manual does not tell you how to delete the historical data directly on the cuff and I haven't been able to figure it out.<br /><br />The WBP202 comes boxed with a user manual and USB charging cable (no power brick). The seller says it comes with a carrying case but none was included with my WBP202. The cuff itself is medium size and should fit most arms without any issues.<br /><br />The WBP202 uses triple measure averaging. I looked at several BP cuffs and with most there were reviews of accuracy and inaccuracy. I believe the WBP202 cuff is fairly accurate, although it may read slightly high on the diastolic side. I own an Omron 7 BP652 wrist cuff but the readings I was getting on the BP652 seemed like they were consistently lower than what my doctor was reading. I compared my most recent reading on my Omron 7 BP652 wrist cuff on 10/4/17 to my most recent doctor's reading on 10/4/17 and my doctor's reading was 31 higher than the systolic reading and 1 higher than the diastolic reading of the BP652. When I tested the WBP202 against the BP652 today (10/18/17), the WBP202 had a 29 higher systolic reading and a 9 higher diastolic reading compared to the BP652. Other Amazon reviews confirm the WBP202 is accurate.<br /><br />The WBP202 rechargeable battery charges quickly and provides long battery life. The cuff can be shut off by long pressing the Start / Stop button or it will automatically shut off after about a minute of inactivity.  Overall I am satisfied with the WBP202 and hope it will last for several years. I recommend the Square Trade warranty Amazon offers which kicks in after the two year manufacturer warranty.",B002VLZ8C6,AF3KUXBHIUTXZLKZIEOQAZPQ6PWQ,2016-07-27 11:30:18.000

4,Five Stars,"""So, I've been on a litany of meds for 40 years. I have BPD1, major depressive disorder with psychotic features. I sometimes have delusions and hallucinations. Both suicidal and homicidal ideations. This has been utterly unbearable because no antidepressants or antipsychotics have ever helped me. The antidepressants cause me to feel suicidal. About a year ago, doctor gave me Deplin. I take it when I need to and it works. Just 3 days ago, I felt suicidal and was hearing the voices inside my head. Day 3 of Deplin and I feel better again. I only use Deplin and nothing else. Yes it's tough managing the other symptoms by myself but they're nothing next to my depressive episodes. All I can say is that L-methylfolate is helping me. It is the only thing that has ever helped. There are some side effects like palpitations, insomnia and some restlessness but I don't care.""",B07NDSBY85,AE4MHGSTQY2APYZ4AGX4IJRXWCBA,2022-06-06 18:19:43.740

It's so rich and moisturizing. This formula was for anywhere you need it including your face. It as follows: (written by a doctor) 6 ounces of any petroleum jelly, 16 ounces of Johnsons Baby Lotion, 4 ounces of vitamin E cream. You put in a bowl or 6 cup glass measuring cup and blend/whip it together very well. Put it back into your same containers or use new ones.

The second, the scent is unfamiliar, it has always had a funny smell but this is a different scent. And lastly, the product is not thick as all the ones I have bought in the past. This has a very thin texture feel. I will put an update in a few weeks to see if the results are the same as always. Crossing my fingers! I hope this is not a fake.<br /><br />Update: So the product is not as effective. I had finally had someone bring me the original from our of state and we all saw major differences. So needless to say I will not risk ordering from here again.

4,Good product but beware brain fog,"I love the clear design. The first arrived one of the hinges bent with a plastic cover. Seller was very responsive and sent replacement (this time in proper boxing). Unfortunately, I got varied readings only seconds apart making it frustrating to use. I suspect because the scale dimension is smaller than ""normal 12x12 "" digital scales, that affected readings depending on foot placement. So perhaps if you have feet under 11 inches or less, could be accurate?",B01A90FMHQ,AETZIQ2K2DOVUL2ST4ATDITP63AQ,2016-05-06 02:17:00.000

3,Not bad tasting!,The Taste is so bad however this is the way you do it. Fill a glass 1/4 clean water (duh). See through glass. Get a wooden flat stick and keep pounding it in stirring until dissolved -- that is a thick Pasty dissolved formula. Plug nose or do not breath. Swish it around plug your nose do not smell or taste it take a big Swig and swallow it. Keep rinsing and swallowing...take a big glass of water keep continue rinsing your mouth until you get it down but do not breathe or taste anything yet. Then take a piece of gum strawberry flavored or strong Wintergreen flavored. Swish it around your mouth do not breathe that and keep the gum in your mouth and slowly start to breathe. This works.<br />😣😌😐😊,B075V82RGZ,AFH2M7CKGA2IYBODRMDD6V7CHM3Q,2018-01-15 07:01:50.841

1,Great Value for the Price -- just a bit TART,"Please do your research before starting on a melatonin supplement. Here are a few pointers.<br />1) A small dose is better than large ones for sustained use. To this effect, the dosage in this capsule is good. It is not a megadose like 2-3mg (milligrams) like most other melatonin products; it is only 3mcg (micrograms).<br />2) If you tend to wake up in the middle of the night unable to get back to sleep, a time release option would be a good option for you; this is what this product provides. This is why I use this.<br />3) From what I have read, taking a break from melatonin supplements for about 2 weeks every 4-6 weeks is a good idea. Try this if you feel the product is not effective anymore.<br />4) Pick up a bottle of sub-lingual melatonin in addition to this for those times when (a) you have forgotten to take the time release melatonin 30-60 mins before bedtime and are still wired, or have woken up in the middle of the night and cannot fall asleep.<br /><br />I am back to buy a second bottle of this product.",B07SYNTL34,AGKKZFBQSPHNPUBO43LE5XHME7DA,2022-08-31 15:13:03.404

5,You get what you pay for,The directions say to take 5 pills at once.  My candida infection has caused me to become allergic to numerous allergens including several food allergies.  Just to be on the safe side I decided to try 1 pill before taking the full dose.  Now long after taking it my upper arms started itching.  I took two benadryl and it went away. I'm glad I didn't take the full dose!  I had high hopes this would work but it seems like I am allergic to it.,B01M8HNDGK,AGZ3OD3NSNM22X4D54LS5FTBLZWQ,2013-10-29 19:47:39.000

3,Don’t buy this one....,"I have only taken the pills for a month. i had my hair braided up in a protective style a month prior to taking the pills so i already had new growth (half inch). I just finished my first bottle and took my braids down which were in for two months by this time. Im not sure if my new growth was normal for a two month period or if the pills aided my normal hair growth rate in the second month but i had at least an inch maybe a little more. I have a bottle left, when I finish the second bottle I will see how much growth received but i will not buy again i want to try manetabolism. Many many reviews on youtube, seems better than hairfinity.",B0001IU542,AEKW7Q53DZZN2K35BS3R7XFNDJ4A,2017-01-06 05:57:46.000

5,It came very quick,"Nutrablast Vitamin B12 seem to be the Best that I have tried.  The taste is good, although there are some ingredients I didn't care for in the tablet.

2,Love the NOW products.,"I have been using this product for a few years. Searched online for a safe pre-menopause remedy. I'm very concerned about some supplements as I have breast cancer in my family history. The fact that this product is plant-based, estrogen-free, and supports breast health was a big sell for me! I bought it and week by week I could feel that they were working. My moods and temper evened out and I didn't feel like hurting anyone anymore! Hormones are balanced! I'm 52 now, through menopause and still use the product daily. I will continue to take this product and highly recommend it!",B07BBLC7J6,AF5NSGW4YVE2GZZ35ZDA2KOCTYLA,2017-06-30 15:26:53.364
