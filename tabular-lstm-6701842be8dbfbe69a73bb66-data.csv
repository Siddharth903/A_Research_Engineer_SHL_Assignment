By 11 pm I was violently ill - the sickest I have been for a long time, including stomach pain and tenderness.  I was fine by morning.  I called my relative - we decided to use 1 capsule 3x per day, slowly building to 3 capsules 3x per day.  So far so good!!  Generally I am not oversensitive to supplements.  I feel that the dosage recommendation on the bottle is rather irresponsible.

4,Fast & Accurate,"These multivitamins have the essential vitamins and minerals to be used as a prenatal pill. I've compared the supplemental facts with 'Nature Made' and 'Rainbow Light' and they have exactly the same Daily Value %. Most importantly for the child, the Folic Acid which is at 800mcg which gives you 100% of your DV.<br /><br />....And who can forget, it's HALAAL!!!!",B07CW639YG,AEO2EEKH7PNRIL2GOHCFKHKQK3ZA,2020-04-02 20:31:16.489
3,I loved these and the taste was great also,"I have tried many DIM supplements and this one actually works. The reason it works better is the microencapsulation, which allows it to be absorbed. most other supplements add Bioperine which aids in the absorption. But other brands didn't give me the results that these do. I only take two capsules a day. It is helping me lose weight without making any dietary changes. Getting older really slowed my metabolism.

4,Very pleased,"I am a male in my late 50's and am it really good shape overall (again - for my age) and hate taking a fist full of vitamins and having them come back to haunt me later without really believing in their efficacy. This is different. I do not get the burpee stuff going on and feel like I want to puke midway through a workout. I truly do feel that I am getting far more value out of this than the typical ""multivitamin pill"". I especially like it that I feel the B1, B12 and B6 ""working"" if you will, but but do not feel jittery or like I am crashing a few hours later (I would not recommend taking though before you go to bed). I have tried other liquid vitamins and I really have to say that this is the best I have found - for my needs anyway.",B001HX3APQ,AHJPTXLGRPTRXHNGRRAPU3LNRNQQ,2020-09-05 17:10:50.669

3,DID NOTHING FOR MY OBSTUCTED PASAGES DUE TO THE HEAT FROM THE HEATHING SYSTEM.,"I am a personal trainer and fitness instructor and I was looking for a multi-vitamin with the most bang for my health buck. It is hard these days to find a good multi-vitamin that has good ingredients and is really bioavaliable for your body to use. This product has a plethora of great things for your body including CoQ10 and many of your Colloidal Minerals which is a bonus from a lot of mult-vitamins. A few things that I wish were different are:<br />1. Vitamin D comes in several forms and in this multi-vitamin it is in the form D2. Ideally, especially in the winter you want vitamin D3 which is primarily given from the sun.. The other main downside I saw with this product is first it’s not organic and under other ingredients at the very bottom it says “natural flavors” which can be almost anything including high fructose corn syrup (HFCS). It also has potassium skrbate as a preservative, which is not great. Why not ascorbic acid or something. Overall, a great product though both for quality and price.",B000TDE2W0,AERTMR7S2KPG2M4SSIUDSLEQBEXQ,2009-01-20 18:25:02.000

3,Good quality scale,"Impressed with this vitamin D formulation and have reordered it many times.  Vitamin D is one of the few essential nutrients that the human body does not produce on its own in sufficient quantities, especially since sun exposure has become frowned upon.  This product has my highest recommendation!",B01A90FMHQ,AGDARCOLFGZTWIZUXHFA2F4EBXCA,2019-03-15 16:26:43.646
4,Good value with a decent taste.,"I am so happy to have discovered this product! It has all the attributes I look for (non-GMO, grass-fed, no hormones, etc.) in a healthy nutritional supplement. Without a doubt, it is giving me energy, mental clarity, and an overall feeling of well-being. My sleep and digestion have also improved. I am taking a heaping measured dose three times a day. Every time, within a half an hour, I am pleasantly pleased to realize that I can actually feel its positive effects. I am hand mixing this into my protein drink or almond milk and find that if you take a minute to hand-blend this product with just 2 tablespoons of liquid before adding in the rest of your drink, you will have less lumps in your final result. (I am open to suggestions if anyone knows of a better approach.) This product tastes delicious and has a delightfully creamy, slightly sweet taste on its own. Yes, it may seem to be a bit pricey but it is a small price to pay to feel great again! I've already ordered my next container and plan to make this product a regular part of my health maintenance routine.",B008TSOZ60,AHWPD7ISZYYGCUDPV4LGMDFPAPMQ,2022-03-03 20:37:16.209

2,Appearax Biotin Tabs,I was diagnosed with PCOS by my reproductive endocrinologist several years ago and had to take a round of fertility meds to be able to become pregnant. Ever since having my baby (2 years ago) I have been having an extremely difficult time with losing weight and feeling fatigued all the time. I happened across an article that recommended Beberine as a beneficial supplement to those who suffer from PCOS and insulin resistance. I have been taking it for just over a week now and have dropped 9 pounds. I feel so much better as well. I was never treated with metformin but supposedly Beberine works in a similar way on the body without all the side effects you hear that come along with metformin.

It's not that the plain is bad, but I have just found myself skipping it quite a bit.  I don't think I'll have any problem taking this every morning.  I saw this same oil in a health food store for $29, but with Subscribe and Save I can get the same size for around $13, delivered to my door as often as I want it.

My Vit D levels did not go up in the next two blood tests. My doctor has suggested I try to find some fast dissolve vitamin D tablets. He said that this might help my body absorb Vitamin D. We'll see as I don't have another blood test for a while<br /><br />These are plain white with no markings on them. They are very fast to dissolve. I put one on my tongue and a few seconds later there is nothing in my mouth. These have a taste almost like lemons or oranges. It is tart but it isn't sour or terrible tasting.<br /><br />Because they taste good and there are no markings on the pills, I am a bit concerned that my children (or their friends) might get into them and take a lot thinking they are candy or something.

Sometimes I have to stand on this 10 times before I get a consistent reading several times in a row. I also tried it today to weight my puppy. I stood on the scale with the puppy and every time it said 151.7, then I got on the scale by myself and it said 142.2 several times. That would mean the puppy is 9.5 pounds. Wrong.

4,Great scale,I bought this along with Vit C in gel cap form because a doctor explained on his website that he tests the blood of his patients regularly for the levels of various supplements he recommends and he claimed that pills seemed to result in extremely poor and uneven levels in the body.

5,Dr says liquids are better absorbed,"1.  I have the A360 and the lame Polar wrist strap broke (that little white plastic thing fell out) and really started to stink and thus it was time to look for a replacement.  Since the Polar strap is really lame and expensive, it was a no brainer NOT  to get another one from Polar and thus I decided to take a risk on this third party strap.  The following are some bottomline notes:<br />  a:  Size:  one size and it does tend on the larger side of things.  I a man, 5ft 8in, medium build and this strap fits snug, but I have to go near the end of the strap to do so... which leaves a lot of strap at the other end... which I cut off.  I would think that for many women, this may be too big (of course depending on build).<br />  b:  Does this thing actually work?  At first, I thought this was a dud because the inside ""housing"" didn't have the rigid component that the original Polar strap has.  Furthermore, when I put my A360 insight, the thing popped out when I put the strap on and I was about to return it.  Instructions?  Don't even bother due to the low quality of instructions and basically everyone who is buying this already owns the A360/370 and thus knows how to put it in.  However, all I have to say is, really look at the unit in the strap, ensure that it is completely embedded in the strap and it will definitely work / stay in place.  I can't explain it any better;  it definitely does work, the price is right, good colors;  just work with the unit and you'll be happy with it.",B003XDI3NC,AHP2C3ASFNTP7SW225RLUYRX2NZA,2022-01-14 20:23:06.413

3,Solimo vs. Vaseline,This scale is accurate with large numbers you can easily see. It sits above the floor on round button circles in each corner. Another feature I like bc if water gets on floor it goes underneath and won't ruin it like my other scale. The price point is great at 13.00 and fits perfectly by my shower in a spot seemingly made for it and I don't have to move it. Just step on and voila...weight. Thanks very she'll too.

I was given these to drink and they tasted exactly like a fruit punch drink, Kool-aid, etc. It helped me re-gain the weight that I needed to and during the last three months, it has allowed me to train for a half marathon without worry of my weight becoming unstable again.<br />Thank you to the makers of this product.

4,Four Stars,This package of three has NO VISIBLE EXPIRATION DATE. Every consumable must have an expiration date--this does not. I have ordered this jam previously and it has always come with a visible printed expiration date. The bottles say  check the neck for the expiration date but nothing is printed there. Upset as this came as a shocker. Feel very uncomfortable getting a consumable without an expiration date.,B0001IU542,AEEZVNQXUQKWOZG7H44RPVQNHE3Q,2020-03-17 13:53:53.039

3,Inconsistent??,I already had this product at home but purchased it through you all for a friend because I liked the one I already had for me. My friend only had the BP cuff that you had to place onto your upper arm and wait a while for the results. This is much easier for a spot check and also gives your pulse rate as well. I highly recommend it. It's also easy to take on trips rather than a bulky BP cuff.,B00ZPRHYHK,AEKPBJRMWE7EAJUILMLD5EFMY2DA,2018-04-13 19:33:13.725

Works wonder in moisturizing my skin and wake up the next morning with beautiful soft skin.<br />I have acne prone skin but this actually soothes out my acne and doesn't give me breakout after applied from night before.<br />Texture and scent is similar to a cold cream but a bit lighter.<br /><br />The only downside is that it is slightly greasy and does not have SPF (UVB/UVA) for day, other than that, I love this product.",B002VLZ8C6,AGTBOZOLAIEVHDYZGZ5RPZEA4VNQ,2019-11-12 14:16:06.075

2,Pésimo,Even though the expiration is 12/2020 they look and taste “old”. They have a brownish orange color and are hard to chew.

It may be because my candidiasis is basically ""under control"" or it may be that it's working but I don't feel it, or it isn't working.  I put three stars to stay ""middle of the road.""

4,Five Stars,I could no longer find these in the store.  I had been taking two a day for over a year and I never get sick like I used to.

3,Very light and absorptive,"I live in the cloudy northeast where getting sun for 8 months of the year is difficult.  I use this cream at night before bed.  Last spring my D blood levels were excellent.  Actually better than when they were repeated in the late summer when I had not used it and instead relied on lots of sun.  D is very important for so many health issues and many people are very deficient in it.  This is a very pleasant way to get a large does of D3.  The cream is metered, so you don't overdose.  If you only wanted to get 5K units, you can estimate a half-dose by depressing the top half-way.",B07SYNTL34,AGSXASO63WKJI6OTJT4GW7SJJFHQ,2019-02-16 11:58:12.830
2,Great addition to caffeine,"i have a SUUNTO Quest that i bought in The Philippines (about a year or so ago)..  On the silver plate underneath my watch, the word ""QUEST"" is engraved (see attached Photo). i never wore it until recently. Then the rubber on it broke near where the watch lugs connect to the watch.. So i came online and looked for a replacement. The Quest is an older version of SUUNTO's line of watches & hard to find bands for. But i found here on Amazon this Band that specifies that its for the Quest. i look at the Photos here & it didn't look like it was compatible, but i thought Maybe i'm not seeing something that it will show in person.. So when i got the Band & tried to fit it on.. i could see immediately, there's no way it would work.. & i sent it back.  Usually i would not even bother with a return for something so cheap, i just would have tossed it in the garbage.. But i didn't want my money to be kept for something that was such an obvious ripoff.",B003CFB2CA,AEUBM5IAKYVPSDEZ735TLVWFCOBA,2016-03-23 23:41:38
2,POC do not purchase,"I've been using this for years. I simply squirt into my mouth when I am at the refrigerator to ensure I get my daily Omega 3's. Wish it were cheaper as there is not a lot of flaxseed oil in this. Pure flaxseed oil is cheaper, but often upsets my stomach and this one never has.

5,but it is a disappointment because it really looked nice,Arrived as expected and not sure how it is working but like the idea of getting aome extra vitamin d that doesnt have to be filtered by my liver.  I pit on the bottom of my feet.,B07CS691CZ,AHPL6NVWSQHV4UWV347ZA7UWQONA,2019-02-23 18:54:33.811

4,Herb Review,"Shipped promptly.  Seems good, though I can't say what in particular it is doing for me, since I made an enormous change in my protocol over the course of June and July.  But I started each new thing separately, so I do know I tolerated this one well.  I have reordered since the first bottle ran out.",B0797HCZVV,AG45XHNO6X53WOJSLU7RFUAGENVA,2012-05-12 03:07:14

2,Great value with superior results,"I recommend starting slow with this one.  I'm fighting a candida infection and have been for some time.  I decided to add this to my protocol, and took the five-pills twice a day for two days, but by the evening of day two I was having a serious Herx reaction that drained all my energy and left me with major diarrhea.  I could barely get up off the couch and was afraid to stray too far from a bathroom for a day and a half.  Now I'm feeling like I've more or less recovered from the reaction.  My take away is that the stuff seemed to kill a lot of candida, which is good, but definitely too much at once.  I'm going to try again in another week or so, but probably starting with one pill and slowly trying to work my way up.",B07MT7LVV2,AEMV3XC2ZFUJB7YW4BAX7GBSFIWQ,2019-02-02 02:59:44.315
4,Excellent support for identified symptoms.,"Way too expensive and the  can was only half-full (although the weight was correct) so I assume it’s to make it look like you’re getting more than you actually are. Also, the flour was clumpy. I would have sent it back except it took a week to arrive and I needed it for a bread that I was baking.",B07KML9JDP,AEUB4SARJ6T5V3FNJ4SSDYSRLN6Q,2021-08-30 13:09:07.169

4,Five Stars,Great idea...terrible taste after a few days. You have to eat one 4x a day. The first week was tolerable. After that the smell and taste just made me gag. I wasn't able to continue using them and switched to another product. Maybe instead of a huge vat of singular flavors they can do a bottle of mixed flavors. Would help to keep the product palatable.,B00X1IK5FI,AGTJUSGTI5WOZDEYKJ37L7EY3SFQ,2017-03-20 21:45:59.000
4,Good,"I am 48 years old and hypothyroid.  I have been taking DHEA for over 2 years without a break.  I exercise daily, and feel like DHEA has helped tremendously with hormonal issue and weight stabilization.  I usually bought the supplement at Whole Foods but you can't buy as many in a bottle that way and I don't want to run out as quickly.  I did have my hormones tested a few years ago via a saliva kit and the results indicated low DHEA, which is why I started taking it.  FIRM BELIEVE IN THIS STUFF!!!",B07SWJ3QJQ,AEHI3SABZTSZ5QFRAKDZTOHQYIDA,2017-09-24 21:29:03.840
4,Helped increase my VitD levels and I felt better!,"The scale feels pretty flimsy (the metal grey bars) they move around quite a bit but because I leave it in the same spot and hardly move it, it doesn't bother me. Occasionally, it gets ""stuck"" and adds the weight of the glass but clears itself out after. Also, I can step on it one minute with a reading of 140, and then have a full bottle of water (1lb) and no change in the weight. In general though - it does stay within a one pound range. All in all, it mostly does the job accurately and looks modern and nice with my bathroom decor.",B01COW00O2,AHF4MVJYJDRKGMMVEASD3G5UOBUQ,2018-06-21 00:33:51.031

5,Good quality for a good price,"I have been using this for a few months now and overall I would say it’s pretty good! Moderate boost in energy but this alternative is much better than pills sitting on my stomach.<br /><br />I will agree with a couple of other reviewer‘s and say that about 60 seconds after I take it I experience a tingling/heat feeling in my head and particularly on my face. It goes away after a minute but it’s a bit weird! Almost like a rush.<br /><br />Overall, however, I like it and will continue to take it.

3,Great,"Someone gave this product one star because it contains xylitol.<br /><br />Really?  It says it has Xylitol right on the bottle and right in the advertising text.  If you won't want to eat Xylitol. don't buy a product that contains Xylitol and then give it a one-star review because it contains exactly what it said it contained.<br /><br />Also, Xylitol is a naturally occurring sugar in many fruits and vegetables.  It's not some lab-only concoction (not that I personally care.)  Sheesh.",B00E4MSRL4,AHX6DGROOZTA7RAF7WRHCH6JGNNQ,2021-03-24 09:54:02.241
2,I like the powder form of this Moringa and Amla fruit,"I had never worked with chestnut flour, but was tired of using almond and coconut flour for my gluten free Paleo recipes.  Began experimenting with this chestnut flour with great results.  It has a light texture and slightly sweet flavor. Though I don't often eat bread, gluten free bread made with this flour has a very nice texture, so that I can enjoy an occasional sandwich or toast.  I will definitely keep buying this.",B07MNM99HG,AF4RZSP46ARKMDSEYI2TKKKK66UA,2020-04-07 04:46:49.826

5,Nice product!,"Bought this when PURISURE was called Wholesale Health Connection. Printing on the bag I received indicates ""100 % Satisfaction Guaranteed. If you are not completely satisfied with your WHC purchase, contact us for a full refund.""<br /><br />Purchased the product, quality was good, when bag was first opened. Within about 30 days, the product started smelling rancid. I presume the rancid smell was due to the bag's airtight ziplock seal quickly being made useless, by any product that passed by the seal. Even though the package shows an expiration date of 8-30-2020, I had used less than half the bag (in the winter of 2018,) before product became too rancid for safe / effective use.<br /><br />The company has NOT bothered to respond to ANY of my attempts to reach them. Two voicemail messages, a week apart, were NOT responded to. Two emails I sent, (help@wholesalehealthconnection.com and returns@wholesalehealthconnection.com,) were NOT responded to. Based on the packaging graphics, same phone number, and same voicemail messaging, for Wholesale Health Connection and Purisure, Purisure is exactly the same company as Wholesale Health Connection.<br /><br />If I were to order the product again, I would immediately transfer the contents to an airtight container, and toss in a silica gel pack, to help eliminate moisture. On the other hand, I see little reason to trust this company with another order, since my four efforts to contact them have accomplished nothing, aside from wasting my time AND money.",B00VWID4YS,AHOAUIR4NB46A23FRWY7FNHCKBAA,2016-06-16 22:44:06

3,One Star,"I must say that when I first heard about this product I was extremely skeptical. I am a college student, and although I'm ashamed to admit it, I have used prescription ADD medications in the past to help me focus and give me the energy to complete large assignments. I began looking for an over the counter supplement that would give me similar concentration and energy, which led me to elebra. I have been taking these pills for a week now and I am very satisfied with the results.<br /><br />I have been taking elebra for five days and have felt results every time. Although it is recommended that you take three capsules, I only take two. I took three once and felt sick (nausea and a headache, due to me being a small person with an extremely low tolerance to all substances). With two capsules, however, I feel an almost instantaneous boost of energy and concentration. I took two pills this morning, after hours of laying around my house staring at my to-do list with no drive to do anything on it, and within twenty minutes time I felt focused enough to attack my first task. Even when you're feeling lazy, elebra gives you the perfect boost of energy that you feel that you might as well do something productive with it! I've even taken these pills before a night out with friends to increase my energy and social engagement. Works like a charm.<br /><br />Of course, the results are not as profound as prescription ADD medications, but if you're looking for something natural and over the counter to give you just enough energy to get through the day, this really works.",B0013NB6YW,AE2PNWV3FV6OXIHIS2DNAW3T42VQ,2022-11-22 04:09:55.192

I love that this is instantly in my belly and i do not have to wait for dissolving pills and such. I felt a sense of calm after the first use. The dosage i am taking is 1000 mg a day. After three days my veins are no longer bulging out of the top of my hands. I am very satisfied. The packaging is wonderful. Easy to stash in the fridge and easy to scoop out of too. I just scoop out a 1/4 tsp. and mix in a shot glass of water and shoot it down. It really does taste pretty gross but the benefits far outweigh my whining about the taste. I love this and now have ordered some Potassium. i cannot wait to try it. I am overall very satisfied with this entire transaction, product and any other aspects of this purchase.

My issues do not resolve after replacing this vitamin, I will come back and update this review, and I will also update this review, if within just over a week, they do.

5,It works,Horrible.  So painful. Unit took one minute and 44 seconds for a reading while my arm and fingers were throbbing.

Its recommended only one tablespoon per day for a child and he always begs for more, so I always have to keep on reminding him that its only one per day.

5,Great quality and easily absorbed.,"After suffering through a sinus infection and bronchitis and being prescribed many antioniotics and a steroid treatment, after two months I was finally feeling better, still not great but better. Then I noticed my tongue felt like I had a hairball stuck on it. Yep it was covered in a white coating. Went to my clinic and my usual doctor wasn’t in that day so I saw another provider that put me on nystatin for 14 days after diagnosing it as thrush. Made perfect sense after all the antibiotics. 13 days later there was no improvement on my tongue. I went to the walk in clinic and the provider there said clearly I had Candida overgrowth and nothing but a Candida diet, a lot of probiotics and other supplements was going to help. So I began the miserable diet and ordered oregano oil, coconut oil, probiotics and a multi vitamin. I went online looking for anything that might help. I felt terrible most of the time and my tongue was so disgusting I was willing to try anything. I found info on this product on someone’s Candida blog. Well kinda pricey but I had to do something because the other stuff wasn’t working. So I continued with the diet, probiotics other supplements and added sf722 into my routine. I started feeling better, I felt like I was beginning to feel alive again. Still the nasty coated tongue though. After my months supply was used up I ordered again. Still feeling like I was improving, I was having more good days than bad. By now three months had gone by and I was following that diet, taking all the supplements, doing anything and everything I saw recommended for Candida overgrowth. But why was my tongue still gross? So I said well I gotta see my primary doctor again, this is just not right. He took one look in my mouth and said I dong think that’s Candida at all, it’s bacterial. I left ya office with an antibacterial prescription and instructions to return to a normal diet and just be me. I still had some sf722 left and since it was so expensive I decided to finish it off. I have been done with it for a couple weeks now. The antibacterial did it’s job on helping me feel better overall, although my tongue is still coated, which I’m told may take months to get rid of but at least after the culture, it’s peoven to be not Candida. And At least I feel human again. But I find myself considering ordering more of the sf722, because even though I never truly had a Candida problem, and this probably does help with that, I just feel that it made my guts and body feel better in general. However it could have been related to the diet I was following also. So I realize this may not be all that helpful if a review, if you have been diagnosed with Candida or even suspect you may have some issues with it, give this stuff a try. I totally recommend it, Candida or no Candida.",B01MTK7VP4,AEBDI7NHC4WN7HBQMEVKBKMVPMHQ,2017-04-06 19:17:06.000

4,Calidad buen precio,"OK. So, I got this product yesterday and somehow forgot all the reviews about the terrible taste. So, what did I do? I recklessly put 1/4 tsp of the straight powder directly on my tongue and looked around for my water bottle. Oy vay!!! That was not an experience I would care to repeat again in the near future, far future, or any future! That was seriously the most putrid taste I have ever experienced in my life! I drank and drank water and more water. No dice. It wasn't letting up. So, I looked around for the strongest tasting stuff I could find in the fridge, which was sauerkraut. No go. It just made the sauerkraut taste horrible too. So, I drank more water and resigned myself to just letting it wear off. Took awhile.<br />Today, I read over all the reviews with the word ""taste"" in them. Realized that juice or lemonade or anything of the liquid sort was not going to cut it.  So, I thought it over and came up with the following technique:<br />1. take 1/4 tsp (or however much your chosen serving might be) stir and dissolve in about 4 ozs of warm water. The less water, the better. It's just a carrier and you don't want to extend the experience...<br />2. Add 1-2 Tbsp of lemon juice. Stir again.<br />3. Take 1 heaping teaspoon of Peanut butter, and eat it, but leave a good coating on your tongue and all around your teeth and mouth.<br />4. Give your liquid a final stir and drink it all down without breathing (you might want to actually hold your nose while doing this, if you're not experienced at it).<br />5. Take a bit more peanut butter and eat it.<br />6. Now you can resume breathing again. You will not have tasted a thing, except the peanut butter.<br /><br />The idea is that the peanut butter coats your gustatory glands (the glands you taste with). Holding your nose while eating or drinking anything actually blocks you from tasting most anything. You might get a bit of the lemon taste coming through, but nothing else. If you eat the second spoonful of peanut butter, it will clean out all other tastes that may have gotten through when drinking the liquid. I know this because I ventured taking a breath while I was drinking the Magnesium and I did encounter a slight taste of the foul stuff when doing so. Very slight. Maybe less than 10% of the original taste from yesterday. However, I stopped breathing, finished drinking, took the second helping of peanut butter and breathed again and encountered nothing but the taste of peanut butter at that point.<br /><br />I will expect a statue to be erected in my honor by all my grateful followers...  😄<br /><br />I cannot yet comment on the actual quality or effect of the product, hence the neutral 3 stars. I consider it a plus that I am still alive after yesterday's experience...",B00L3LC7MY,AEBQI5DPFKWMWQGGGDQZMIVQJGGA,2018-03-09 22:10:36.785

5,Crystakized asprin,"I posted a more detailed review on the &#34;starter kit&#34;, however, since I have also since that time purchased an additional bottle of Resetrol, I thought it would be best to include my review here: I am a very skeptical and analytic individual for the most part so I agreed to try Resetrol only because one of my colleagues strongly recommended it. I decided that I would try it, but would remain as objective as possible so I could share with everyone else my thoughts on the matter. First off, let me say that I did not think there was anything wrong with pornography and/or masturbation. Count me in the camp of people who think (thought) it might even be healthy. After reading The OPAN Program manual, my thoughts have admittedly changed a bit. I have realized that perhaps these things may not be as benign as I had previously suspected.  Many of the patterns of behavior described in the book I have seen in my life. While the book isn't that long it gave me a new perspective. I almost found it enlightening and for that reason alone, I decided to put my heart into the program and started taking the Resetrol supplements. Here's what I can say after a couple weeks: 1) It is not as easy as I would have thought to stop doing something that previously I didn't think was a problem 2) The Resetrol supplements help. I know the book has explanations for why they work, but being the skeptic I am, I still don't get how they are working 3) I feel good. Not that I felt that bad before, but I guess I was just used to the constant dysphoria. This has been a pleasant change. I'm still on the fence sometimes about this whole thing, but when I see the difference this has made in my life in just a few months I can't help but wonder if there is something to it.",B017DT4HM2,AGXKDLECOGPXS6HVRJBP7QFXE77Q,2021-04-20 12:14:21.542
5,Great Value,"This product gets 5 stars from us.  My husband is notorious for getting a nasty cold and cough at least several times a year.

I mix the powder in my first cup of coffee with cream but I'm only taking a smidgen instead of the least recommended dosage to stop the heart palpitations.

3,Precio,Based on some reviews I was a tad concerned but I have purchased many products from Bulk Supplements and have always been happy.  I was not disappointed this time either.  I am combining this with Calcium Citrate for a morning shot with a bit of water. Kinda chalky but I wash it down right after with some more water.<br /><br /> Thanks to the reviewer who posted the 1 to 2 ratio!<br /><br />The only challenge I have with the package it that they never seal correctly once you open them.  The zipper just always wants to not quite close.,B000FGXMWC,AGHICHNKHBZ6HQADGDMOKCY6ZIZQ,2017-02-11 03:37:39.000

2,Everything went smooth love the products will purchase again,"Update 7/16/17: Thank you so very much to all readers who inputted to me on a solution for the non-supported Apple App issue. There are work-arounds for settings on Apple devices to allow the app/software to be &#34;trusted&#34;, (and function when opened) and as one excellent response noted, there ARE other apps on Apple's Appstore web-site that are registered and approved by Apple, that will work w/ this model/make watch.<br /><br />I guess my gripe is with the manufacturer (and/or seller) in that why don't they simply offer an app that is Apple verified and supported like so many other fitness trackers  out there are? I've come across several very similar watches on Amazon that have full support through Apple for that model's app.  Install the app through the Apple App store and no issues arise in dealing wth using a &#34;3rd party app&#34; to use as a work-around for the problem.<br /><br />-----------------------------------<br />So sorry to find out upon receiving that this company (China) and its app is not sanctioned, supported nor registered with Apple nor its Apps. It installs outside of any Apple source (App Store or iTunes) and the security feature in IOS prevented this app from running after installing it in what the company does for a work-around to be able to get it installed at all (and not from any Apple website).<br /><br />I got flags for unknown developer, and a security warning (is any data shared?).<br /><br />Returned this to Amazon and ordered one of many other &#34;Fitbit Clones&#34; that do have supported software in Apples App Store. Learning experience and if you are shopping on Amazon, be sure to check reviews verifying that particular Fitness Smart Tracker has an app that -IS- on Apples website and you will be good to go!",B07SYNTL34,AEERERLRHFNL5WNWVAFMF4U4Q5LA,2019-03-04 06:26:55.831
3,Love,I take a dropper full with half glass of organic pomegranate juice.Can barely taste the phytoplankton in the pomegranate juice.I believe it is helping.

2,Hih,"We've had this scale for about 2 weeks, and so far so good! I purchased this scale because birthing websites recommend weighing yourself and then weighing yourself with your baby to check your baby's weight, so wanted to make sure I got a really accurate scale (or at least one that gives me the same reading in at least two consecutive weighs). I always read all the 1-star reviews for a product before deciding whether to buy, and if the problems noted in the 1-star reviews are serious enough or consistent enough, I choose not to purchase the product, even if it has 4.5 stars out of 100+ reviews. I was on the fence about this scale based on the other 1-star reviews, but am glad they proved not to pertain to the scale we received.<br /><br />The product arrived two days earlier than expected, came with the necessary batteries, and worked perfectly upon first use. My husband, brother, and I all weighed ourselves twice to make sure we got the same weight measurement each time, and we did! For some reason it takes a while to secure my husband's weight each time he steps on the scale - it always fluctuates 0.2 - 0.4 lbs in difference and we don't know why - so he stands on the scale for up to 15 seconds sometimes before he gets a settled reading, but for my brother and myself it takes fewer than 5 seconds each time. This hasn't changed since we got the item, and since my husband doesn't care too much about his exact weight (0.2 - 0.4 lbs deviation is not that big a deal to him), we like the scale just fine. The bright blue LED screen is quite bright, though, and stays on for about 30 seconds after use, so I just wouldn't weigh myself in the middle of the night after using the restroom, since it would definitely jar me awake. The scale is very lightweight and thin, making it easy to transfer between different bathrooms/hard floors.<br /><br />Would definitely recommend!",B07QFVHRTT,AGXGENG5OPUFRE5V7DEMN4W2XSJA,2017-11-27 02:58:51.943
4,TOO MANY OMEGA 6 IN THIS FORMULA,"Update 7/6/20: Have had the scale about two weeks now and it is working great. I think I made an error and had not lodged the batteries in correctly because I took them back out and once I placed them in again it worked fine and lit up the way it was supposed to. I have a second scale that I was trying to replace with this one and the weight is also consistent with the weight reading on that scale, so I know it is working properly.<br /><br />I have had this scale for about three days now. The reading on day 1 was fine but since then has been giving my the Lo symbol. I am switching out the batteries in the morning. My numbers also never lit up so I am literally having to flash my phone light at it to be able to even see what it says.",B01N2AW5KM,AGDVLCHJSGUXRTN52JGDOZ73JQUQ,2020-05-30 23:41:43.515

5,Really like,"I recently purchased this item after researching a natural way of helping my 8 year old calm down. I chose this product because of it's story of creation as well as the reviews I read. We are just 30 days into the use of these pills. He is taking them with the fish oil as is recommended. I'm not sure exactly what my expectation was. I have a child that is very active and has issues with impulse control at times and I have to often say get control. Taking these has now become a part of his every day routine and he'll even say to me - Mom, I need my chill pills. I haven't noticed a huge change in him but I've asked him if he feels that they are helpful and he says yes. We'll likely continue using these for at least 3 months to see what continued difference we see.",B017DT4HM2,AGQO66D326ZTV7J4EIHKQR6YKFNA,2017-04-22 20:57:10.000

5,Don't buy,"This is a nice, thick, greaseless cream I use on my face and any other dry skin areas.  I have used it on my daughters, too, and really feel the moisture all day long.

4,Nova B Complex vital to emotional well being!😊,"I like the product, I personally feel it’s not as strong as their brand of wheatgrass, which I have been using since 2018!  It’s has a little scoop spoon in the jar which works.  Nevertheless, this company’s quality of products are exceptional.  I use their spirulina tablets as well.  I would definitely recommend!!",B000JFBD5W,AGVFHXN6RBGRI2AU5FGGZDAX6CKA,2015-12-19 21:25:39.000
5,love this for help moisturizing dry skin,"Just opened and setup. It was fully charged in 2 hours, setup was fast (less than 10min). The vibration for alarms was great strong but not annoying.<br /><br />My complaints. It looked like a mauve-ish pink it was actually a very pale peach color. Oh well. The charging situation looks like it could become a problem. You have to yank pretty hard to remove the band and expose the plug- which fits both ways into a usb charger/transformer (not included), I think this may break over time. I will update this review after some use.",B07VHGX6C7,AHAS5LQDDRUN3F5IJHCSJKSNYGAA,2017-05-02 01:30:44.000

5,Easy to read,This scale feels very light and also looks pretty shiny. I received this a couples day ago and the main reason for buying this is that my old weighing scale wasn't digital and also it took a couple of minutes to show the weight. This scale shows the weight right away and also seems to be pretty accurate. The one concern about this weighing scale is that it looks pretty delicate and might easily break if used incorrectly.,B00012ND5G,AHYEOGGRZUAWDOXSTVXRPMAN4EHA,2017-01-17 02:14:16.000

4,Great boost,"My 9 year old got one of these a couple of years ago and has worn it non-stop since then - she only takes it off to shower and swim.  It doesn't track her sleep accurately, but seems to work great for tracking steps.  App to sync works well (I only sync periodically, not constantly/regularly) Battery lasts a long time, even after years of use.  When her first one broke after a couple years (end opposite charging port snapped) we bought the exact same thing again - $20 is a great price point for a kid (or an adult) - we definitely recommend this!",B002VLZ8C6,AF2ASF2QQILBH3WJVFNK5RPZ3WGA,2018-01-22 21:12:54.733
2,Four Stars,I don’t like that it requires a very small Phillips head screw driver just to change the battery.

3,I'm hooked!,First one I ordered was a dud. It would only say 0.0 no matter what I put on it. Returned and reordered. The second one is perfect. Quick and accurate reading.

1,Great product!,"We've had this scale for about 2 weeks, and so far so good! I purchased this scale because birthing websites recommend weighing yourself and then weighing yourself with your baby to check your baby's weight, so wanted to make sure I got a really accurate scale (or at least one that gives me the same reading in at least two consecutive weighs). I always read all the 1-star reviews for a product before deciding whether to buy, and if the problems noted in the 1-star reviews are serious enough or consistent enough, I choose not to purchase the product, even if it has 4.5 stars out of 100+ reviews. I was on the fence about this scale based on the other 1-star reviews, but am glad they proved not to pertain to the scale we received.<br /><br />The product arrived two days earlier than expected, came with the necessary batteries, and worked perfectly upon first use. My husband, brother, and I all weighed ourselves twice to make sure we got the same weight measurement each time, and we did! For some reason it takes a while to secure my husband's weight each time he steps on the scale - it always fluctuates 0.2 - 0.4 lbs in difference and we don't know why - so he stands on the scale for up to 15 seconds sometimes before he gets a settled reading, but for my brother and myself it takes fewer than 5 seconds each time. This hasn't changed since we got the item, and since my husband doesn't care too much about his exact weight (0.2 - 0.4 lbs deviation is not that big a deal to him), we like the scale just fine. The bright blue LED screen is quite bright, though, and stays on for about 30 seconds after use, so I just wouldn't weigh myself in the middle of the night after using the restroom, since it would definitely jar me awake. The scale is very lightweight and thin, making it easy to transfer between different bathrooms/hard floors.<br /><br />Would definitely recommend!",B00HUWPH2W,AEFCI2RAJID4ZRSYX4VCWHMU6JKA,2019-03-05 20:18:01.732

1,Better and quicker,"Much easier to put on than the original band, which I threw away.  More comfortable with more adjustments and flexible.  Also nice to change colors on occasion.  I had a Fitbit HR before the Garmin, and liked it okay, but the crystal chipped and the band came apart (not replaceable) after a year.  Didn't like the fact that I had to charge it every three days.  Garmin has a replaceable battery that is supposed to last a year.  Don't miss the HR part, as I don't run, but walk instead.",B00F7OZJR8,AG4KYJNUCXQYKB5FPNNWEUK5HOIA,2021-10-17 12:05:04.593

3,Love the fragrance,"I love this ginger powder! As soon as I received it I opened it and instantly sneezed because of the spiciness of it. That was a really good sign to me.  Then I noticed the color of it which is like a lovely fresh piece of ginger. I could tell again it is a good quality ginger that is used to make this powder.  The suggested serving size  on other ginger powders I have bought on amazon and in the shops is 1/2tbsp to get the nutrients and benefits from it.  With this ginger their suggested serving size is 1/2tsp in your tea, smoothie etc., and trust me you feel and taste that 1/2tsp way more than others that I have used! It has the right amount of kick to it, it is so potent!  I used it to settle a stomachache that I had by  putting it in hot water with organic lemon juice and it did the trick.  I also put it in my cacao drink it makes it lovely and spicy!  My search for good quality powdered ginger is over! I will never buy another brand of ginger powder again. I have found exactly what I need in this ginger powder.  YAY!!! to Yae! Organics Organic Keto Ginger Root Powder!!!",B00UI2139W,AF4YKALQBQJOCFSSGFY7ZFC2KDOQ,2016-05-12 14:06:40.000

4,We like it,"This is a great scale for the price.  I use it a few times a week to monitor weight loss / gain. I have confidence knowing that it is consistent and dependable.<br /><br />The weight takes about 5 seconds to register - the numbers fluctuates within 1 pound when stepping on, and you must remain still until the number on the display starts blinking.  At that point you can step off of the scale and the number remains on the display for about 20 seconds.  Stepping back onto the scale after the display turns black then results in the same reading almost every time.  Also, no need to tap a foot onto the scale to wake it up.  Just stand on it and remain motionless and wait for the reading.<br /><br />Another thing I like about this scale is the width and length - I'm 6'2&#34; with size 12 feet that are wide.  I don't have an issue with foot space, width of the scale, or covering the display when standing on it.  I've never once felt like I was swaying / going to tip over, and I've never had an issue with accidentally stepping to close to a corner / side of the scale and had it tip over - meaning the rubber feet underneath are nice and close to the corners making for good stability.<br /><br />I use this on a hard tile floor so I can't speak for use on carpet or softer materials.  Also it doesn't have bluetooth or wifi connectivity - those things didn't matter to me, I was looking for size, a nice display, and consistency.  If these are qualities you are looking for (as well as a good price point), this scale is a great choice.",B07CS691CZ,AGWMKQUNBP2MGTUVVZ53ASXFJAAQ,2019-11-12 02:29:17.951

I also use it with essential oils for therapeutic massage and it's a great medium.

4,Good product!!!,"I bought this mostly to help me get better sleep, and it seems to help. I take 1/2 tsp or so a little before bed. I found that it doesn't like to dissolve in water, and it tends to clump. To get around this I have been mixing the MG powder with some other drink mix powder while dry, and THEN adding water. In my case I'm putting about 1 tsp local store brand Metamucil, then 1/2 tsp of MG, shake around or stir until it seems mixed together pretty well, then stir in cold water. The other powder seems to lessen the amount of MG that is in direct contact with itself and it dissolves much better.",B07SWJ3QJQ,AFAZBPOPLVUYHTVDNFC3OLA2DDZA,2020-07-28 00:16:28.223

4,Product w no seal?,Sadly this was just ok. The 1st bottle I bought was good and tasted ok almost like the old centrum liquid vitamins. If I only bought this once they would have a better review. After the 1st bottle was finished I ordered another. The second bottle was horrible tasting. I couldn't finish it every morning I dreaded taking this and just threw out the last bit. I will not buy another and cannot reccomend this product.

5,Five Stars,"This is the only vegan supplement I could find that has all the Omega essential fatty acids, and I would have given it five stars if it hadn't been for the taste.  Other reviewers had said that it tastes great.  For me, it tastes like syrup--it's just too sweet.  Barlean's should reduce the xylitol content to make it more palatable.

5,Organic product! Great!,"Have this and the mango fish oil from Barleans. Both taste great with no oil taste. My kids, who are 5 and 7, take this without issue and the 7 year old views it as treat. I like the Barlean's products and with it being fall/winter here in MN it is a good time to order as they stay cool during most of their trip and when out in front of my door. Heat and light can have a big impact on omega's and I think being able to get the Barleans oils cold are a far better way to get your omegas then with pills sold on a shelf. I am an avid weight lifter and have always noticed a great benefit with supplementing with omega's and generally like to get them from both a fish and flax source at the same time. I am hoping the kids will reap the benefits as they grow and develop and these flavored oils are a great way to ensure they get them without complaint. Would recommend this product.",B01LMPGSXO,AH6XSOC3ELR3PHXHTJEOIORWB3CQ,2014-10-30 20:03:31

3,Five Stars,"I wrote this review on Inositol and it's benefits. Choline should be taken with Inositol because they compliment each other. I have several autoimmune diseases and my liver is affected by it. Choline helps detoxify the liver and here is more information on it. Having PCOS is an endocrine disorder and it takes a toll on your cognitive abilities and causes depression. I also have a 3 children with Aspergers and using Inositol and Choline has been extremely beneficial for them. I hope you feel my review as useful. Please do your own research however!<br /><br />Choline supplementation is a must for anyone whose daily diet doesn’t supply the established Adequate Intake of this crucial nutrient. Choline deficiency can lead to kidney necrosis and liver disease, both of which can be successfully treated with choline supplementation. Choline deficiency is also very serious in terms of brain function, resulting in diminished cognitive abilities.<br /><br />Choline supplementation has been proven to have significant nootropic properties of its own, ranging from better memory retention and recall to enhanced learning ability, more efficient thought and verbal processing, and increased concentration and focus. It can also act as a mood booster and has been used in the treatment of anxiety, depression and related disorders.<br /><br />Though choline and inositol are both important supplements in their own right and each provides many physical and mental benefits, there’s a powerful synergy between them that makes them far more effective when they’re taken together.<br /><br />I buy from BulkSupplements because of the integrity of the product, the no frills packaging and the inexpensive price. Now Choline has a slightly bitter/sour taste but if you mix it in a sweet drink you shouldn't notice and neither should your child.<br /><br />If you have PCOS listen up, this product is amazing for you and I'll tell you why. It controls moods, anxiety, OCD, helps you lose weight, helps with depression. Inositol also decreases testosterone levels which some of us really struggle with. Hence the reason we are constantly plucking, or loosing our hair. It's a real struggle. We also face infertility. It increases your fertility. During a placebo controlled trial they found that the women who had taken 200mg daily showed improvement in ovulation, weight loss and increased levels of the good cholesterol  known as HDL. You can take up to 2000 mg daily but you have to go really slow or you can get serious diarrhea. Many of us that take Inositol take it with choline because the two have to work together and we put it in our favorite beverage and drink it.<br /><br />My daughter has Aspergers and as OCD this this is how it can help your child even if they don't suffer from Aspergers but has mental health issues.. Over that time, Inositol combined with Choline (I suggest you order that also because they work the best together) have been used by the body to reduce stress, improve mental health, contribute to cellular integrity, Now, we can apply some of the time-tested benefits of Inositol supplements for the treatment of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, anxiety, mood swings and depression.<br /><br />I really hope my reviews help people learn how these vitamins help you control your bodies with supplements but in no way shape or form, do not stop your medications from your dr. This is not to replace your medications! This is to work in conjunction with them. Once the Inositol starts to work, you will notice a huge change in your life.<br /><br />Supplemental inositol is used in the treatment of a number of physical conditions and disorders, including psoriasis, high cholesterol, hair loss, and diabetic nerve pain, as well as a range of cognition and mood-related conditions. Because inositol helps regulate levels of serotonin in the brain and has been proven to have substantial calming effects, it acts as a natural anti-anxiety remedy and has been successfully used in the treatment of panic attacks, depression, ADHD and OCD, and PMS/PMDD.<br /><br />Inositol supplementation is typically associated with a variety of cognitive enhancements, ranging from better mood to improved sleep, increased attention span, and better learning and retention.",B07PJSDNFL,AEO5TRSNGUFG3JSEYP4OWXMSXU7Q,2017-06-03 01:04:16.000

I can't say thank you enough to the makers of this cream.  I have bought this and sent it to my daughters and they love it too.

3,I am sure the supplement is good. But the taste is awful,"I like the idea of taking a multivitamin in one pill.  I was currently taking handfuls of quality vitamins that I carefully selected.  That being said, how do you review the benefits of a vitamin if there are no noticeable changes in your health?  I replaced this with my usual routine and feel like it is a good quality product.  I have noticed before that if I skip my vitamins, I am tired.  This didn't happen when I switched to this.  I did get a headache one day (associated with another product I was trying) and wondered if it was because I was not taking the magnesium supplement that I normally take.  I checked the bottle to see if this contained magnesium, and it did say it contained 100%.  Nevertheless, I took my magnesium supplement in addition and did gain some relief from the headache.  This seems to be a quality product in one pill.  As for the size of the pill, I have no problem with it, but I am used to taking handfuls of pills (supplements/vitamins) all at once.  However, for someone who has a hard time, it's definitely not tiny.  I would say it's about the size one would imagine for all of the daily vitamins packed into this one pill.<br /><br />I received this product for free or at a reduced discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.",B00GU2HKS2,AHZRJMY7OTI3P4M6DD4ZARK6O6BQ,2020-01-28 12:46:02.128

3,This new flavor rocks.,"I love this cream! I mostly use this as a night time moisturizer and I can truly stand behind this product because I am on my second jar. I figure this gives me solid support in stating my results since I have figured out most of the nuances of this cream. So here goes...<br /><br />The texture of the cream is really comparable to a cold cream but is a little thinner. I honestly thought I could never use this because I have acne prone skin but gave it a try because someone recommended this to me. That being said, it has not made my acne worse or better. Instead, it just has really balanced out the ph of my face so now I'm not worried about half my face being dry and the other half oily. The tone of my skin is more even and I have no dry patches.<br /><br />As for anti-wrinkle properties, I can't say it has made a difference in regards to this but then again I really don't use it for this purpose.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great bargain and I would recommend this to anyone looking for a good night time moisturizer as this can get a little heavy for the morning. Plus, you really have to let the product sink into your skin and that can take some time. If you don't have that much time in the morning before work this will be a problem for applying makeup as I found out.<br /><br />The jar is pretty big and the amount you are given is generous when compared to other brands.

5,I recommend this product,"I went with this brand as the Health Ranger (Mike Adams) sells it on his site.  He tests everything he sells for impurities and quality....so if he sells them, they must be good.  Anyways, I am very happy with these and have no complaints at all.  In fact, I gave a bottle to someone I know with Lupus and almost immediately, she noticed that she had much more energy to make it through the day.  Apparently, her Lupus symptoms usually kick in at about the same time every day.  After taking these a couple of days, she said she would make it through the day no problem.<br /><br />I also take these and have noticed much less bloating and maybe even weight loss.  I would highly recommend these.  BTW, they taste great.",B00T9L8T3G,AFKJEODGD3FNIANCACX53T2OK2AQ,2016-06-19 07:19:24.000

Maybe that's not long enough. I do feel a little more relaxed after taking the supplement and I feel like it helps me fall asleep easier, but as far as staying asleep and the quality of my sleep, I do not feel an improvement. Plus it tastes horrible! The best method I found for taking it is mixing it into a small amount of water, make sure it dissolves, and quickly gulp it down. I need to take magnesium supplement, so I will continue taking it and hope that my sleep improves.",B000FGXMWC,AE5APTAYKEGT2X4NVIANZTCBHYRA,2021-02-23 01:47:15.927

Nine times out of ten, it will say that I reached my step goal while sitting, literally sitting at my desk. When I'm walking, half of the time, it doesn't count my steps. The only reason I will keep using it is that it has a watch feature I can use without reaching for my phone, and I can get in the habit of wearing a step counter while I save for a FitBit.

I saw the maker of the band reply to another review that you have to sleep more than 4 hours a night, uninterrupted, for it to track sleep.  I know I'm sleeping a full night's sleep, but this thing just isn't working.

Tried fiddling with the batteries and they just popped out of the slot. I picked them up and tried them again and put it on the floor and STILL no response. I assumed maybe I may have been over the weight limit and tried my niece who is [54] pounds and my sister who is a whole 100 pounds lighter than me and STILL nothing.

2,Disappointed,"I use gummie vitamins all the time, even though I’m an adult. I have a problem swallowing so many supplements. And I like the taste. This product, which cost $24.99 for 150 gummies, was delivered with all 150 gummies mushed together. I have had this happen once in awhile w other gummies, a few here and there. But this seemed like the bottle was extremely overheated at some point. I could not get any gummies oout without using a sharp knife. From the top down to the middle (haven’t finished to the end yet ). I am not sure that the potency is ok. I would think not. Things happen. I’m most annoyed that the vendor did not even respond to me when I wrote to him. I can no longer reach him/her through any other way than this honest review. My recommendation?

It is much easier to use for people who are alone or who have trouble getting an arm cuff on right. Function is fairly quick and quiet.

Very easy to apply, and doesn't stain clothing or take forever to soak in.  However, the medicinal purpose of the cream isn't quite as great as I was hoping.  I have been using the cream for almost a year now and my Vitamin D levels have only increased by 15%.  I have my own set of issues with my Vit D levels, so I'm rating it 3 stars instead of higher, based on what it has done for me personally.

3,Incredible !!,"ALL of the Barlean’s Omega Liquids are FABULOUS! My sister told me that my nieces and nephew loved to take this and I ordered some for myself and my kids. I’ve always wanted to take Omega, but I despise the fish taste. I’ve taken pills before that said “no fish taste!” And I still had a fish taste in my mouth an hour later. Y’all...these do not tase like fish AT ALL. They taste exactly like what each flavor says. We have tried 4 flavors at this point and my kids really do love them as much as I do! I will say that I think these are super expensive, and there are some months where I really just don’t have the extra money to spend on this. I wish the coat was in the $18 range. Some flavors of these are almost $30 or more, and that’s ridiculous to me. But if you’re looking for something that tastes great and that has 0 fish taste, this is the Omega product for you!!",B00DG8TEFK,AEARS6B4TFBPUE4EWNN44NNDLJ5A,2022-10-21 16:42:12.719

I take it with other cleansing supplements. I don't see any difference so far with my candida overgrowth. Im starting to doubt whether these pills are worth it.<br />2. The reason I started to doubt is because I now see the quality control os lacking on these... I just received a bottle that was sealed but no dessicant was placed in the bottle. As a result, all capsules got glued together due to moisture build up. Not sure if it's even safe to consume at this point, plus it's impossible to take them out anyway. I wanted to replace with a fresh bottle and it tells me that this item is not eligible for return. Well that's a lot of money down the drain.... any vitamin shop would accept a return in this case. I've been supporting the company buying this product for half a year and this is what I get when theres an issue. Not cool.",B01N2B8SQ1,AGGSARHO73F7XHVBR42S33IJAFEQ,2021-02-21 01:46:02.356

3,nice scale for the money,"Just a really quick review to share my (unique?) experience:<br /><br />Taste: No problem, especially considering you're drinking vitamins! I honestly expected the taste to be worse than it is. You just shoot it down - Don't let it touch the sides of your mouth, the insides of your cheeks, et cetera and it's fine. It doesn't even taste that bad using this method.<br /><br />Results: Excellent! During the 1st two+ weeks: I saw substantial and very noticeable improvement overall. I felt great! Energy level was up I was happy as could be with this product. I could hardly believe how lucky I was to find it!<br /><br />Then the bad news: Somewhere around the 3rd week Of taking these vitamins, I developed this unexplainable kidney pain.<br />Just both my kidneys hurt all the time , to the point where I was practically hunched over. It was not fun (and a little scary to be honest). Now I drink nothing but bottled water all day long — lots of it. Been drinking lots of bottled water for years now...<br />I figured that the only thing it could be from was the vitamins — so I stopped taking them right away....<br />In less than a week the kidney pains subsided, until they were completely gone.<br />But my energy, and general feeling of well being that I got in the 1st two weeks is also gone. 😢<br />1st 2 Weeks: I feel amazing!<br />3rd Week: I feel like I'm going to croak from kidney failure.<br /> As crazy as it sounds, I'm thinking about giving it another shot... Hopefully, I'll be able to report on here as to exactly what happens?<br />If the kidney pain starts again I'll just stop it - For good this time.",B0797HCZVV,AGM23UZDYLLEDTPWP3V25W3KJRWA,2016-03-26 01:26:15.000

4,Everything I expected,"Whoa .. where do I begin here? Okay lets start off with how amazing the taste is! I don't even know what to compare it too because it doesn't taste like yogurt to me as this is a bit more sticky & thick. Also, there is not a dairy flavor either so that is why I cannot compare it to yogurt. I am so glad I listened to the sales rep at my local Vitamin Shoppe. I thought he was just trying to get me to spend more money ;) This stuff goes for $19.99 in the V.S. right now and amazon is practically giving it away at a much ressonable price. Subscibe & safe, that's all I'll say about that.<br /><br />How do I use? This stuff not only provides my body with important nutrients but because the flavor is so amazing, my smoothies just don't taste the same without it!<br />Here is my recipe for the ultimate smoothie.<br /><br />1 cup of spinach ( don't be a sissy! you can't even taste it ;)<br />1/2 cup of cabbage<br />1 cup of frozen or fresh broccoli<br />a dash of vanilla extract<br />a dash of cinnamon<br />1 cup of almond milk<br /><br />@ this point you are going to mix everything up in a blender and your smoothie will be green :)<br /><br />Next add the following ingredients ..<br /><br />1 whole banana<br />1/4 cup blackberries<br />1 cup strawberries<br />2 tbsp of Barlean's Organic Swirl Flax Oil/Strawberry flavor<br />1/2 cup of almond milk (if you need more then add more!)<br /><br />Blend again for another minute or so and enjoy! I drink this bad boy before I exercise because it's LOADED with everything your body needs to get through a tuff workout. You can drink this after as well but I usually find it hard because I don't carry a blender with me ;)<br /><br />Also I can't stress enough about using organic products, almost everything I buy is organic and frozen, or if it ain't frozen .. I cut it up and freeze it in little ziplock baggies (like the bananas). This week I had some left over cherry tomatos and I threw four of those into my shake. You guys! I could not even taste them :)<br /><br />All you taste is the fruit and like I mentioned before .. that wonderful taste of the Swirl Flax Oil. Yum!

5,Shoulda ordered a different one,"Amazon products are up charged for absolutely no reason. Bought these because going to the physical store is sometimes a challenge for me. I ended up going anyways and these are twice as expensive as store brand. AND it was a bulk pack. Absolutely a disgrace.<br /><br />The quality is okay, only cosmetic stuff like the label was wrinkled. The taste is fine. My other complaint is that the safety seal on the top pullout tab didn't work as intended and instead just peeled half off.

5,Good product,"Pros: Cheap, reasonably accurate, easy to use and read.<br />Cons: Cheap, low quality control.<br />I liked this scale because it came in grey; a nice contrasting color less likely to show prints. Plus, it was pretty much the same as higher priced models. Well, the low price comes with it's drawbacks. It failed within 36 hours. I asked for a replacement and it was hassle free. Mind you that doesn't include the hassle of dropping off the dead unit at the UPS store. The new one arrived reasonably quickly and has been functioning for the last three days. So, maybe it will last; but I'm keeping the packaging until the 30 day return period expires just in case.  I recommend you do the same. That said, the light on the digital readout is a bit askew compared to the previous unit and doesn't equally light up the display. While a bit annoying, it's not enough reason to return it. However, it does indicate rather sloppy assembly and low quality control. Like I said, you get what you pay for. If you don't mind the possibility of spending time returning one of these for a replacement; it's a reasonable scale at a good price.",B07SYNTL34,AEDENEDZHUMCK6T2GGVV5ORQXNYA,2014-04-01 02:55:36.000

4,Easy to use.,"The suggested dose is 100mcg but this has worked well for me.<br />I swing shift every week night to day and this makes all the<br />difference.  I'm a person who wakes up after 4 hours, so I'll<br />often take another if needed. Else I'll just lay there for 2<br />hours not sleeping.  It just takes the edge off your thoughts<br />and lets's me push them back into sleep mode.  Absolutely no<br />side effects.  Larger doses made for vivid dreams.<br /><br />Update:  I have switched to liquid form when I ran out of<br />these. The liquid directions are 4 eye droppers for 1 mg.<br />So I use about 1/2 dropper of liquid or 125 micrograms.<br />It works well and very fast.  Like about 5 minutes my eyes<br />start to droop. The very dramatic effect fades after a week<br />but who cares? At this low a dose you can take another dose<br />4 times a night if needed.",B008A0PVM4,AH4GETIUB2DLCAWSNNTFSZYCDK6A,2019-02-21 13:35:04.070

3,"Half Year Supply, Works Great","I decided to take a break from drinking, and I bought this product to help myself feel better faster, and it totally works! I'm only a week in, and I'm feeling calm, energized, with a total sense of well being. I normally get headaches while quitting cold turkey, and those have been minimized.<br /><br />My only complaint would be the horrible taste. I'm not a fan of Stevia, or the berry flavor, which makes it hard to add it to just any smoothie, so I suggest that you dissolve a scoop in a little bit of water, and just take it as a shot! It gets the unappetizing flavor over with quickly, and personally, I find it fun to take an alcohol free shot! It makes me feel like old times, but with no hangover in the morning!<br /><br />I could only give four stars because of the taste, and the price. This product is definitely worth the money, but it is really expensive.",B073X7MNQF,AFV6F6VCMVI2SIM7Z2BGJRAIKP6A,2021-02-16 19:31:30.902

Thankfully, the seller does free returns via Amazon for defective products, so I returned the half that were bad.  They were all from a certain batch, I forget it's expiration date now, but the good ones I got all had an expiration date of 12/18.  I don't know if it's the seller or manufacturer that caused this problem, but I hope it's fixed for the future!  Other than this problem, it's a fantastic product with a mix of vitamins that really should always go together, and a good price with this seller.<br />Update 11/30/17:  The last batch I ordered was fine.

My business plan used to have NOW as the top supplier of quality, fairly priced oils, but not anymore. It would cost me so much to keep using this, I’d never sell anything. If you’re buying this for personal use, it’s 100% awesome. If you’re $$$ conscious, go with another brand that is priced better.

4,Four Stars,"Generally automatic blood pressure cuffs are less accurate than taking a manual blood pressure, but this one of the worst that I've seen. When using the cuff, versus checking manually this monitor shows anywhere between 12-18 points lower than your actual readings. This is very dangerous for anyone needing to continually monitor their blood pressure.<br /><br />Also, the device has failed several times to get a reading resulting in discomfort and painful occlusion for an extended period of time.",B00F0T41GU,AHAQHNOD2BROL6QFD2QPCFHX56FA,2010-01-30 12:07:55

4,Great extract. Problem is that when I needed more,I took several antibiotics and they only helped partially to cure my SIBO and I always had relapses. After just a couple of weeks taking this product my SIBO is completely gone and I get no relapse as long as I keep taking it. And the best: no side effects!!!! I highly recommend it for anyone with digestive issues.,B07MKGM64W,AFNRVJMFOPBXI6ZYFMOBUMFM6UWA,2018-01-30 18:26:08.578
5,"Great for dry, sore skin....","I ordered this because I always get a rash on my wrist when I use the silicone bands. I was a little nervous about the leather strap because the fitbit just slides into it and the button looked like it could maybe come undone easily in the picture. However, the space for the fitbit is really snug. I have to push it out when I take it out to charge. It doesn't move at all. And the button closure stays closed with no issues. Even if it did come open, the fitbit wouldn't come out on it's own. It's very comfortable and I have gotten some compliments on it. I love it!",B077BQ13ZV,AE5QB4IELIVCNFBOM4WRQ2C55ZXQ,2017-06-04 17:10:47.000

4,"Good deal, for this scale!",I bought this for my daughter's bathroom because of the color... But it's really disappointing.

5,Excellent product. Great For KIDS.,"While ordering I read the size 25 grams per packet, after delivery I noticed that there are 5 packets of 14 grams each. This is a lie. Also note that each packet price in INR is 5.00. And the seller is selling for $14 for 5 packets. FYI $1 = INR 65. Yes it is a lot expensive but the weight of each packet is incorrect and not fair, I am going to return the entire order.<br /><br />Attached the picture taken the back of the packet with details.",B01A90FMHQ,AHEO2GQLMTD2HNSK3VW2JFQCO4EA,2022-12-11 05:47:43.995

4,Consistent,"Pretty good scale for the money. Thin, sleek design, modern looking. The scale works fine, however the instructions are extremely poor; I had to play with it to operate it as the instructions were basically useless. When you get it take the battery cover off (in back of scale) and remove the plastic tab covering the batteries. Also to change the scale from kg to lbs you must press the tab (also on backside) enough times to change the setting. Other than the instructions, the scale works for me!",B00B7FQNH6,AGQKS76XCVWSGCGXPU5G7I64NDOA,2016-05-23 00:45:03

4,It tastes great.,"It absorbs well, is not greasy and no offensive smell. I applied it to an area that has had eczema in the past and it flared up terribly, other areas it burned and itched.

Well, now my go to product to fall asleep at night.  If you are like me and your mind races the minute your head hits the pillow...this will help!! I apply a full pump right before bed on my inner arm, where my psoriasis is and then rub it in both inner arms.  It really helps the psoriasis stay controlled and helps me easily fall asleep!!

2,easy to give and love this is an organic version ...,"My doctor recently recommended that I use &#34;magnesium glycinate&#34; for my severe muscle spasms, along with other prescription medications that I currently use.  He said that it would possibly have the added benefits of better sleep & problems with constipation.  I found that this particular &#34;magnesium&#34; product is not easy to find in the drugstores so I turned to Amazon.  While looking @ the options I noticed that the description of most &#34;magnesium glycinate&#34; indicated that the supplements were quite large in size.  I have extreme difficulty in swallowing pills so I opted for the powder form.  I must say it is working very well.  Was not looking forward to drinking a nightly mixture of this but to my surprise it is not unpleasant at all.  I can say that it does help with my insomnia & I am just starting to notice a slight difference in muscle spasms.  Started with 400 mg. nightly & am to increase dosage slowly.  I would definitely recommend this product as it is easy to take & the cost (@ Amazon) was very reasonable.  Only gave 4 stars because I haven't been taking it for a long period of time yet.",B000FGXMWC,AF6ATHNI5672ULMU7DJ4PWNHGSDA,2016-07-29 18:32:13.000

5,Good products,"I have eczema on my hands in a terrible way. No dermatologist has been able to clear this up even a little.  I had done some research that said Vitamin D3 could be good for this, and I tried it as a last resort. Within a week, I had SKIN ON MY HANDS again instead of red broken and bleeding places.  It burned a little at first, but it no longer does.  My hands are not perfect, and they still peel at times (especially if I've been cleaning--hubby does our dishes due to this).  Even with gloves, my hands crack and peel, and with this, I can heal far more quickly.  I would say if you have eczema as badly as I do and the doctors are not helping you--GET THIS NOW!!

3,Choline Bitartrate liver - mind supplement - Vit B,"Thank God for this specific product because it actually works and in combination with Thorne Research's Bacillus Coagulans it really kicks it up a notch. I suffered from systemic Candida infection for nearly three decades and it wrecked havoc on every aspect of my life from stability to spirituality. I was depressed, inexplicably weak and melancholy most of the time due to systemic Candida infection. None of the allopathic physicians and most of the naturopathic doctors I went to didn't know what was going on except one doctor in New York City - Dr. Armeni Harris. I went &#34;under the radar&#34; and the doctors begun to think I was crazy because I would constantly tell them something was very wrong with me. Luckily someone was able to correctly diagnose me , but he didn't recommend this specific supplement and I had to find it by myself based on Amazon reviews which helped dearly. Thanks Amazon community!<br /><br />For those who have been suffering for years with Candida I highly recommend Thorne Research's Bacillus Coagulans because if Candida has had its way your probably suffering from &#34;dsybiosis&#34; in your gastrointestinal system. This means if you just take something without taking Bacillus Coagulans probiotic your basically sending it on a suicide mission inside your gut. You need something to balance out the candida overgrowth with beneficial bacterial growth within your gut which can withstand the stomach acids and the hostile environment of your imbalanced gut due to Candida overgrowth. They work best in unison, please watch your diet as well stay away from yeast and sugars if at all possible when you chose to eat. Thanks for your time.<br /><br />February 8, 2017<br /><br />Hello Amazon community, I just found out the root cause of my systemic candida, stomach distress, brain fog, low energy levels, extreme fatigue, breathlessness, and the psychological issues that come along with it. I have &#34;low adrenal function and leaky gut&#34; which was not diagnosed in my youth. This alone has created the environment which candida and all the secondary issues has spread, I am being treated at this time for it. I am still observing LOW MOLD diet (Jill Carnahan)  which can speed up adrenal cortisol recovery with the proper supplements. I have deleted all my other tips because this the &#34;root cause&#34; and if your looking for &#34;adrenal fatigue specialist&#34; I recommend you do it asap especially if you suffer from depression, suicidal tendencies, introverted - lonely behavior, no luster for life and other mental issues created by acute adrenal failure and leaky gut - Restore for gut health really helps (March 4, 2018)<br /><br />Disclaimer:<br />I am not a doctor, herbalist or a alternative physician just someone who cares....",B00GU2HKS2,AFFCORDLD5PLGQIIBWVUJJ6P2Y4A,2020-07-14 00:42:03.935

4,Good,"When an accurate temperature is needed, I just trust this kind of thermometer a little more than the head one. I seem to get several different readings on the head ones. I love that this one beeps once a stable measurement is taken. It is very quick- only a couple seconds. It also has three faces- one indicating good temperature, one indicating slightly high, and one indicating fever. Works well so far.",B00AN9S3VQ,AEDCXFEQ2C5TTZTSHDVHQPUFVBIQ,2020-10-20 12:00:46.741

5,Yes it works to gain muscle mass and strength,"I'm new to working with essential oils and saw how popular the Now Foods brand is.  So I decided to give this a try for making my oil potions.  I really love it!  Coconut oil is great for the skin and hair, so I will be using this in all different beauty products as well as in my bruise and scrape blend.  I love that it doesn't smell like coconut because for me that smell gets too strong.",B017DT4HM2,AHXJMFOL225VLIFIDSTBUHBFBK7Q,2019-01-19 23:00:21.887

2,Great Vitamin D Supplement - Order direct via Amazon Prime,"This is my first smart watch, so I don’t have a lot of basis for comparison.  I like it though, setup was easy, and so was usage.  Some functions didn't work, but I suspect it’s because of my hairy arms.<br /><br />Positives:<br />- Lightweight and comfortable<br />- Step counter works well<br />- Easy set up, works consistently well<br />- Only need to charge once per per week<br />- App notifications work well<br />- Waterproof<br />- I particularly like the feature to notify me when I’ve been sitting in one spot for too long.  I sit behind a desk all day, so it’s a useful reminder to stretch.<br /><br />Negatives:<br />- Sleep tracker didn’t work for me at all<br />- Pulse tracker only works intermittently with hairy arms",B01M192UKA,AHCZWMMHWSFVMGPWJQZBGFYBOTJQ,2016-12-23 03:55:18.000

5,Doesn't work after 3 days!!!!,"I use gummie vitamins all the time, even though I’m an adult. I have a problem swallowing so many supplements. And I like the taste. This product, which cost $24.99 for 150 gummies, was delivered with all 150 gummies mushed together. I have had this happen once in awhile w other gummies, a few here and there. But this seemed like the bottle was extremely overheated at some point. I could not get any gummies oout without using a sharp knife. From the top down to the middle (haven’t finished to the end yet ). I am not sure that the potency is ok. I would think not. Things happen. I’m most annoyed that the vendor did not even respond to me when I wrote to him. I can no longer reach him/her through any other way than this honest review. My recommendation? Do not buy anything from this vendor.",B01M6ZYHK0,AGDONGA5SY4GHDPGYU65MDOI5PXQ,2020-02-28 14:47:17.093

4,Love it!,"My oldest son has autism and is also a very picky eater. We decided to try a multivitamin, and selected this brand because we use the Isotonix Might-a-mins Spectrum OPC-3, which he tolerates relatively well. He does not like the flavor of this vitamin at all, it's kind of an odd orange flavor. I have not yet found a way to disguise the flavor with any other juices where he can't detect it. I will keep trying and plan to update my review if I have any success.",B078SBDGGB,AG22O6LJV7ONJJGUX6HKXR4BV7BQ,2018-07-17 22:57:28.857

4,A must have in every household!,"I bought two bottles, one for my husband, one for me. We both have hypertension and have prescribed medications. It has been six weeks and he has decided he would rather take the celery seed capsules than his medication. His blood pressure is a lot better and without the unpleasant side effects he had been complaining about. I am still taking my medication but I've noticed that my readings are much better than they have ever been on the medication alone. In addition, I have had a pain in my side for well over a year that was barely made bearable by Tylenol and ibuprofen. I suspect kidney stones. Anyway, since I started using the celery, the pain initially shifted down and has now gone away. We will both continue to take these because we have seen real results.",B01BODTUNO,AGUZ63LYQ4EZC3SYKZHODFGU2ODA,2016-12-26 23:49:24.000

5,Digital bathroom scale,I got this for cuticle care for my nails. It works well for that. Does not have any scent at all which was a surprise. I wouldn't mind it having a scent but it would work well with essential oils without a scent to overpower the added oils.,B00EIS9NTY,AERNJ6VCVDHXEGKIQJU37ZAUZRBQ,2021-02-03 08:21:45.139

3,Great if you want an accurate weight scale,"It seems to be accurate enough for what I need. It gives consistent readings. It was consistently 1 degree low (when tested on a healthy person), but that is probably just a result of measuring orally.",B07SYNTL34,AGE4K335UBPL5HHYI2T3ALB3YPUA,2016-01-19 18:17:41.000
4,Great B12 Sublingual!,"I have been taking this for years, and it works great for keeping my blood sugar under control.  I take it 1-2 times every day.  I noticed that for me, if I do not take this for a few days, I start to put weight on (mainly in my belly area).  Once I start taking it again, the weight starts coming off.<br /><br />It comes in capsule form, and is easy to swallow. I have had no bad side effects either from taking it.<br /><br />Also, it contains no artiﬁcial color, flavor or sweetener; no preservatives; no sugar; no starch; no corn; no egg; no lactose; no gluten; no wheat; no yeast; no fish; and is sodium Free.  When I saw what ingredients were not in it, I decided to buy it.  It is hard to find a brand of berberine that does not contain all of these ingredients.<br /><br />I would highly recommend buying this brand of berberine.  I find it works really well for keeping blood sugar under control, and helps with weight loss.",B00X45QGQK,AGG3W72TUNQIG757LQQY5CM5GLXA,2016-04-11 02:31:19.000

4,"Great scales, Great price","This has an odd smell but not a strong one by any means. Only if you put your hand up to your nose to smell. It’s really thick and healing, but not greasy at all. I use it on my hands after washing my hands all day. It really heals and soothes the dryness.<br />Pro-tip: I work at a doctors office and we suggest this to patients suffering from herpes. If placed on the sores it can help make it more comfortable and speed up recovery slightly. It doesn’t replace medical attention, but it can make you more comfortable while you are healing.",B07SYNTL34,AGKC6V3JN7LVGI67CUXTKSA6XYAQ,2022-04-27 19:55:16.307

3,The wafers are huge,"Did not work for me.  Could never get it to fit my wrist correctly to take a reading or manage to find an  appropriate place to hold my arm just so - right height so it was at the same level as my heart.  Then the rest of the instructions -  only the left arm and only after sitting and being quiet for 10 minutes and don't eat 30 minutes before.  Good grief.<br /><br />My doctor's office gets a reading after I've eaten, made my way thru traffic, driven there, and walked into their office from the parking lot.  With this I either got an error message or the reading was off  I tried sitting on a couch, at a counter, at a card table, in an arm chair and none of those worked.  I just want a simple device to check my blood pressure, not something that would raise it higher due to the frustration in trying to use it",B01MZIMAEX,AGROWJ5MXV7E2OBEMTOUVOQ3G42A,2014-01-31 18:19:37.000

I like to take this oceans alive when I go to my cycling class, it gives me so much energy while in class and also after I'm done with my workout.

4,Five Stars,Great and fast!,B01M12AUFI,AEX5CJV3H6W7ZZJBB4GUFPSIXPJA,2016-06-16 18:27:57.000
4,Good,"Great product. Four stars for it because I find it confusing - this type of 1000mg Vit C in 50pcs is less in potency (1100+% / recommended daily dose) than the EXACT same type of 1000mg vit C in 100pcs (that's 1600+%). What am I missing here!? I still recommend it, It's enough for a daily dose.",B00DOPHB8W,AEOBYJ764GXKTYMGMWI4VQ7X7OJQ,2013-08-22 10:31:45.000
3,"but seem to make things worst, instead of better",Works just like the original charger.,B078SBDGGB,AHRMZUTWCBPQS5IVQKPVDK64RQQQ,2013-12-31 15:11:21.000
2,Way off!,This is more of a nuisance that takes too long to give a temperature reading. They say 10 seconds on the description and 8-15 seconds in the instructions included. That is too long but the reality is closer to 30 seconds in my experience. This is way too long too wait when quicker alternatives exist.,B00F7OZJR8,AHLE6HFJIVN47UDLEC6YQ6YEMSOQ,2020-04-28 14:41:17.078
4,Didn't Do Anything For Me,"Tastes terrible, but still prefer it over pills so I can't complain. It's not so bad you gag, it's just very unpleasant. Hard to make a multi vitamin taste good so it's to be expected. I just keep buying it because its the easiest way to get the vitamins I'm missing from my diet.",B07VHGX6C7,AEDYQCYPTMF4YHFA4UZTYRM2G7MQ,2019-06-15 21:15:10.858
1,Great band,A little tart...but so much cheaper than EmergenC.<br />I add to my herbal ice tea every morning. I also mix with coconut oil for a body moisturizer.,B01A90FMHQ,AHDZBLYZK5I6GZ5GB4SNWNACG2DA,2019-09-13 18:09:55.907
1,Love it. Tastes great. A bit hard to get to dissove in water tho.,I love the large pump on these (I have 4 now) but I use them for hand lotion and I have to frequently replenish the lotion and/or mix with water in order for it to gravitate to the bottom-center where the pump can pick it up. I imagine these work very well for oil or anything that is more liquid than the thicker stuff that I use. So far they haven't broken. A practical item -- wish they had more in blue and green.,B07D1915YM,AEJEKNZP7VCS4MHX6TGG3K7JLGSA,2019-11-15 19:44:03.288
4,These are quality vitamins.  Have been taking for 35+ years,"This oil is wonderful......soaks right in, is non greasy and has no odor.  I’ve spent a small fortune on moisturizers and creams and finally discover this fractionated oil for my skin.  I love it and use it on my entire body and face........it doesn’t cause skin breakouts and I have  extremely sensitive skin.  My skin is always moisturized and soft.....like baby skin.  I can’t say enough positives about this oil. I highly recommend this product.",B00028OOZC,AFKBONXM4RBVZILUTQSSQ2N6QY6A,2020-07-04 19:36:21.272
4,Just going by taste alone I was very pleasantly surprised ...,"I've tried 3 flavors and all were good except this one. Not terrible, but not a good taste compared to the rest",B008A0PVM4,AHRE2L7LRSAPGKJMZUN42RTMLMZQ,2017-07-24 00:16:11.925
3,Disappointed,"Purchased this and coconut oil caps to help punch up my HDL ""good"" cholesterol levels. Not sure how it is working yet but they seem to work fine and I feel better taking it. As other reviewers have noted,flaxseed taken like this is very tasty. We purchased both the Strawberry-Banana and Blackberry flavors. Both are quite good. You can mix with yogurt or simply take a tablesppon full once a day. I think anyone would enjoy it.",B07BLJDW4J,AGVDC2UB6J7U7UIGGNN5ALG6EB4A,2023-03-09 15:13:22.086

4,Five Stars,I took 3 a day for 4 days and went from pumping 6 oz to 12 oz. I doubled my supply and now I don't have to take the supplement because my body knows what it needs to do. The best supplement I have tried. It worked quickly. I was very unsure because it only came with 30 capsules but I didn't need to continue taking them. I also didn't notice any gas from my 8 month old.,B01NCLOJFY,AGUGO7YIJPTJR5AGOIOPYH6AXGNQ,2020-04-29 21:21:26.146
3,Five Stars,I love these softgel vitamins.  I take several vitamins each day and I find it hard to swallow them if they do not have some sort of gel coating.  I like to take 500-1000mg of Vitamin-C each day as advised by my OBGYN.  These softgels are great.  Very easy to swallow.  I am very happy with this purchase.,B003EX82HS,AE3Q72F5PYIZNDJOKWL66J7SNBAA,2020-05-02 20:22:44.899

2,No brainer,"I bought these for my kids to use to track their movement throughout the day during the summer break. They had a tendency to sit on their electronics all day and not realize it. These bands are small enough, light enough, and cheap enough to help me prove the point. The biggest downside was that I had to download the app on to my phone to initially set up all the bands as the app wasn't compatible with their tablets.",B00B8YVP24,AEG4AZCRXJHXSLHDP7G2THXS7IUQ,2018-10-12 20:57:52.464

2,Berry berry good!!,"I decided to purchase this magnesium glycinate powder because I thought it had the best value in comparison to the many different brands out there. This product will last for at least 3 full months, while I use a daily amount of 400 mg. Since implementation, I've noticed that I feel calmer and more relaxed. It really works wonders and I use it at night, while I use a vitamin D3 supplement during the day in conjunction. Quality and value remain the top reasons I decide to purchase a product and this magnesium supplement delivers in every way!",B0009VO8EO,AGHYICP2SD4H7YZ4YLKZWJ4IZWZQ,2019-11-13 04:35:00.273

4,"Everything is great, but the drip feature is built in to ...","Nice look and it is consistent between readings.  Large numbers that are easy to read with an attractive blue back light.  Unlike other scales, this one displays the weight immediately so you can see it rising, falling, and fluctuating with movement.  Once it locks on the weight it flashes and stops adjusting.  I like this feature because you can see what the scale is doing immediately.  Other scales will return an error when they can't lock on an exact weight if the person can't/won't stand still.  With this one you'll at least be able to see the range it is fluctuating within.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone.",B018FBMOQS,AFSDGWFPKE5UXXTCEQMSOTOPE2KQ,2018-05-18 01:39:51.697

Nothing compares to this awesome product!",B01DHL1C6O,AGBC727EKNS6B7HT3OFRUZ2TELCA,2018-03-01 14:37:57.519
2,and it is beating systemic Candida better than dozens of other products I have tried,"I came in search of a magic bullet that would give me a little umph with no caffeine jitters.  I find that if I take this in the morning with coffee (as directed), it gives me a bit of a nice buzz.  No teeth clenching, mind you, but enough to keep me alert for A.M. meetings.  If I take it daily it doesn't work as well as if I take it just once in awhile.  The price is OK.  Oh, and the bottle comes in a sweet drawstring cloth bag, that is great for packing jewelry or other small items for traveling.",B017DT4HM2,AFWIWAWACXUG7FX4RCN67VPQHKIA,2015-12-16 05:53:33.000

The past month I added an additional nail, skin and hair vitamin to this product as well as started using a stronger Nail Tek formulation Nail Tek  Extra for very brittle resistant nails.  Finally, using all three products I have very beautiful strong and slightly long nails after about seven to eight months.<br /><br />Not everyone will have to work as hard as I did but the product I believe,  has contributed to the strength of my nails, it just takes time.  You have to continue on the product to keep your nails strong.",B000FGXMWC,AEA2R57UIBB34X3ZL2646AFURAFA,2021-07-02 23:37:53.654

3,One Star,I like the product however 10 servings! The product is not that good that I would be willing to pay $20 for 10 servings! I think this is a total scam that you only get 10 servings. I order hundreds of supplements each year and the lowest I have ever seen in a bottle is 20 days. This shows that this company is only concerned with the money. This does not say trial..<br /><br />I have not seen much with the product.. I recommend just going straight to the source and buying just these supplements Phosphatidylserine the main ingredient for focus and then get some yerba mate for energy.,B07DW3LLLY,AHOKFZSNMUXUMIV4XK7TXIW7AFUA,2015-05-13 23:25:34.000

My doctor recommended 300 mcg time release melatonin and I purchased the Life Extension formula.  I find that when I take the melatonin an hour or so before bed, I do fall asleep more easily and usually sleep through the night with only one wake-up vs. multiple.  Additionally, when I do wake up I feel more rested than when I have taken other sleep aids.  So far, no side effects.",B07MSTYJP8,AHCGSM2O2UZWWTSCWLEKYAC65PAA,2013-10-29 19:47:39.000

3,Durable digital LCD,"I am very happy about the option of having a vitamin C combined with bioflavonoids supplement. Thank you, Thorne. This combo makes vitamin C much more effective by inhibiting the breakdown of C. IMHO, vitamin C is underestimated, it is essential for rebuilding collagen in the body for connective tissues, which is everywhere in your body. Vascular health, cardio health, eyes, skin... every part of your body benefits from C.

4,Love it. Predicts the weight accurately,"I had psoriasis (diagnosed by a dermatologist) on my right arm extending from the wrist to the elbow for OVER 10 YEARS!  I tried the doctor-prescribed steroids which only temporarily cleared it up.  Found this product on Amazon while searching for any/all topical vitamin creams.  Read reviews & tried it in 7/15.  This cream successfully cleared up the patch of psoriasis in two months and it has NOT returned since.  I used only a small amount of the cream on the arm as the cream goes a long way.  Now I just put the cream on the arm 2x/week.  Also got a blood test for Vitamin D & discovered my level was far too low at 18 so I took Vitamin D in pill form at 5,000 IU 2x/day for over a year to bring levels back up to 58.  Then I read the book titled &#34;Healing Psoriasis&#34; by Pagano, D.C.  Had food allergy testing done (cost for this blood test was $200) & eliminated all allergens from my diet.",B07MZMDMRM,AEBMVHHKI3XCXX656QTWQAATO37Q,2018-10-19 03:27:48.062

1,Great Price!,"Remains to be seen if it seems to work or not, but it’s clear that the product is unappetizing - very oily feel and taste, but the smell is sickeningly artificial strawberry or something and lingers on things like cups so that you have to smell and taste it again later. Also, causes me to burp, which is rare, so I have the added bonus of having to deal with that for a little while later.",B01A90FMHQ,AFMZFO2DFGCMKHHKRFLOTH3XSURA,2017-04-30 18:48:34.000

3,it's good on your face,"This product is thoroughly unhelpful. While I appreciate their attempt to develop a “new” approach to health and weight management using behavioral economics, the product came with little information or instructions;, the app is clunky, limited and thoroughly unhelpful. and you step on the scale and get no feedback!  I understandthat they want you to use the scale for awhile to get baseline data and then you feedback, but you still need to have some idea as to what feedbck you will eventually get in order to want to continue using this. They need to seriously rethink several aspects of this product and app - Do not buy this until they work out more of the kinks and make it more helpful for the consumer.",B002VLZ8DU,AFGDPDJBCGSVD7QWKSG3WAE2NZIA,2014-03-03 18:43:48.000

3,Excellent product.,"I initially bought a small size of Magnesium Glycinate Powder to try it out. At the time, my three-year-old large rescue dog was suffering from chronic digestive issues. This product helped to change our lives for the better! I had tried many different commercial and homemade diets, herbs, teas, flower essences, western medicine, a myriad of veterinary services, and unique canine products. None of these made much of an impact on these particular symptoms although may have helped her in other ways. I had never had a pet with this chronic issue before. This Magnesium Glycinate Powder became a key supplement that was later added to her diet, as part of a larger program with Calcium and Boron, and a few other intermittent minerals. It only took a tiny amount of the Magnesium Glycinate Powder to make a huge impact on her health. This new recovery program was miraculous. As long I give her a particular amount of Mg in between 1/8 to 1/4 a teaspoon a day, she no longer displayed gastrointestinal issues. I have given it now to her for the last 2 years. This was quite a relief, after around three years of suffering! I appreciated it so much that I went on to twice purchase the 500 gram size, which lasted well over a year. I found it quite affordable. My only disappointment was that I had also thought it might work for myself, as well. Yet, it did not really fit what I needed. However, I am really grateful that it worked for my canine family member!",B002WJHCBW,AGPZEPZIOM3UVORNIU36LAXT24EA,2020-12-26 01:21:35.243

I was given these to drink and they tasted exactly like a fruit punch drink, Kool-aid, etc. It helped me re-gain the weight that I needed to and during the last three months, it has allowed me to train for a half marathon without worry of my weight becoming unstable again.<br />Thank you to the makers of this product.

5,Five Stars,"I had Candida a few years back and my nutritionist recommended undecenoic acid. At the time all I had heard of, for natural remedies, was a severe sugar restricted diet (still the same BTW) and caprilic acid. Some say oregano, garlic, black walnut, pau d'arco and other natural herbs help also by I have only tried garlic, which is good but I can't tell much effect. I started on the Thorne Research SF 722 and it worked within about 4 weeks, although I think I stayed on it for 6 to 8 as recommended by my nutritionist at the time. I had a recent recurrence and immediately used my leftover supply but was (my bad) not as strict about diet. As soon as I ran out of the SF 722, the Candida hit with a vengeance. I immediately ordered this on Amazon and reinitiated the stricter diet (see below). In between I tried to use caprilic acid, which works, but not as well. I started back on this and, while I can tell I am not ok yet, I can definitely tell it works. I use 6 to 8 gel caps per day. I think the bottle recommends more but, as I recall, 4 x twice a day was what my nutritionist had recommended (actually, I thought he said only once per day but it's been long enough I can't remember). It's only been less than 1 week since the 're-start so I'm still on it.<br /><br />Diet: no matter what, you have to be extremely careful. NO extra SUGAR , none, nada. No sugar added to food, none, nada, nope. Look at all labels. At the very least, 1 month. Sorry folks, that's how to fight this. My nutritionist recommended APPLES (the undecenoic acid can stop up the gut). Just don't overdo on Apple's. Another reviewer said granny Smith, yes, that reviewer is probably right but I remember using any Apple, I just only did about half a day and it worked then and seems to work now. For the same reason, DRINK LOTS OF WATER. 64 ounces a day is often recommended. If you don't, you are going to have a lot of gut problems worse than the Candida. My nutritionist recommended no fruit except Apple's and berries. I am very careful not to overdo berries but they are often lower in sugar than some fruit. Many people say to avoid ALL fruit. I'd just say at first, avoid all except green apples, lemons and limes for a couple of weeks, then add berries in small quantities.  No other fruit for 2-3 months. No sugar for longer if you can or at least 2 months. No cheese or fermented products, no mushrooms, very, very low quantities of carrots and white potatoes for at least a month. Personally I restrict almost all high starch/high glycemic carbohydrates (turn straight to sugar in the body). BUY A GOOD ENZYME AND PROBIOTIC AND EAT YOGURT. The gut needs these seriously to repair any damage done. Read up on this. Take them hours apart from taking the FS 722.<br /><br />4 diet comments: sugar in foods, sweet potatoes, grains and Stevia. (1) sugars in foods: read all labels carefully. Soup and lunch meats/sausage are two weird foods that often have more sugar than you might expect. (2) sweet potatoes: are lower glycemically than you might expect. My nutritionist recommended them and they work well for my body. If you eat them and you do not get better, eliminate, this might be a personal thing. I do NOT agree with the reviewer who said to avoid them. (3)grains, I personally am probably gluten intolerant and eating gluten may have been part of the problem. Avoid most grains, especially wheat and corn. However, my body seems to tolerate rice and many gluten-free grains, especially the &#34;seed&#34; grains and those with higher protein  (e.g. quinoa, amaranth and buckwheat) but the reviewer that cautioned against all grains may be right. I personally still eat grains but NO YEAST, NO RAISED BREAD. I eat rice crackers, rice chips (no corn added, Lundberg makes one), and my own pancakes I make with Stevia. (4) stevia: I do not agree with the reviewer on this one. Even my nutritionist recommended it. But it CAN increase your &#34;craving&#34; for sugar. With me personally, I quelled it.",B00028OOZ2,AFPI4LMF4J4XYO5RCG5SPSHYBHYQ,2018-08-12 18:23:25.644

The only thing I can compare it to are protein shakes from shakeology and Thrive. In the past I have had adverse reactions from those products due to a thyroid disease I struggle with. Thankfully, so far in 4 days of the Collagen product by LIV It's been receptive to my body, very refreshing, easy to mix and go! I tried the Strawberry Margarita and the taste isn't too strong, you can drink it at any point during your day. Its almost like adding fresh fruit to your water. Since its fairly soon, I can't see the improvements of my skin or hair but can absolutely say it already has an affect on my digestion in a positive way.

There is nothing like waking in the middle of the night to a baby that feels hot to your hand and no way to tell if it's just because your baby has been crying or because the baby is sick.... and sick enough for the doctor or can it wait for morning.  Fevers in little babies are nothing to mess with.  Too high a temperature can cause seizures in a baby....  A thermometer is a piece of mind.

Swish it around plug your nose do not smell or taste it take a big Swig and swallow it. Keep rinsing and swallowing...take a big glass of water keep continue rinsing your mouth until you get it down but do not breathe or taste anything yet. Then take a piece of gum strawberry flavored or strong Wintergreen flavored. Swish it around your mouth do not breathe that and keep the gum in your mouth and slowly start to breathe. This works.<br />😣😌😐😊,B017DT4HM2,AFV6ADHI5T2BPDAHFD5UMJ7CSDVQ,2019-04-08 14:07:16.838

2,This digital thermometer is very comfortable for taking a temperature and easy to use,"Right out the box it didn't work. I just went to the doctor the morning I received this product. This scale was 16lbs off from the doctor. I would move it to another spot in the house and it would be even more off. I decided to weight my self in the morning to see where I was next to a scale from my neighbors that we verified worked and was within a respectable range. Still, about a 15-20lbs difference every time I stepped on. I never got the same reading twice. I know a lot effects weight but to be constantly off by that much, well that doesn't help when it comes to weight loss since I would never know what was the correct reading. A couple pounds during weight loss really does count, lol, in helping you see progress. I even went out and bought new batteries, waste of money as there was no change. I would suggest spending about $10 more for something better. I thought I would give this guy a chance, but man it wasn't worth the hassle.

4,Bad product,"Literally crap. We have been using this thermometer we bought for like $3 at a grocery store for YEARS. Very unreliable, so I figured it's time to get serious and purchase a real thermometer. All the positive reviews persuaded me to give this product a try. Ugh, so disappointed.<br /><br />We followed the instructions to a T (wife is a big reader on instructions, and she's the one that opened it up). Yet, our temperatures are never consistent. I know that our temperature is likely to vary from time to time, but what we got each time was just ridiculous. The majority of the time, I was only 93 degrees. What the heck. I really don't think that's true. We would measure about 4-5 times in a row, in the same spot, just to see if maybe it was like a false reading. Nope. All 5 measurements would be completely different. I would be 93.4, 97.7, 95.4, 98.3, and 96.5. What kind of thermometer is this? Even the cheap one we got from the grocery store was at least always consistent in the readings - like if I was 97.6, then I would be 97.6 when I measured again back-to-back.<br /><br />I was sick with a terrible cold for a week, and I felt like I had a fever during some of the days. Obviously no temperature confirmation, thanks to this crappy thermometer. According to the thermometer, I was only 93 degrees despite the feverish forehead and chills. Right.<br /><br />Literal piece of trash. I'm hoping we can return this because it's completely useless. Oh and I want to point out we use this orally.",B00Q71ERRS,AHJNZYWDJNL7ZQUN3O4XHUAZRLDA,2017-03-26 23:47:09.000

The flavors are really good - better than my other brand, but the potency didn't seem quite the same as my other brand. Ended up needing 2-3 tabs to get sugar up vs just 1-2 of my other brand. These tabs were also super powdery - that is something I found very annoying as I would get powder all over when getting the tabs out of the container (note to new users - don't turn the bottle over to get your glucose tabs out - you'll have a mess on your hands and all over everything else around you)! That said, they did their job once I got the dose down and I thought all the flavors were delicious.

4,I've never taken liquid vitamins. I am pleasantly impressed.,"It is a waste of Money.  In the first charge I was amazed how long it stay charged, but I didn't like how long I would wait for it to wake up and check the clock. After 4-5 days the device wouldn't pair with my Android. After a couple hours it paired. Last night I charged it again and now it's completely dead. No water, no bruises or anything. It's a brand new device and after one week it's broken. I don't understand how many people write amazing reviews about this product here on Amazon's and lead others to buy.",B0037M6UWK,AFDQ325PJDFT6QLPAMJB5M2SN6VA,2019-05-09 17:20:46.300

2,It works!,I threw it out as it is sweetened with xylitol and I did not know that before I purchased it.  This is not a sweetener that I want to consume.  Another person mentioned the amount of water in the product also a<br />is a problem.  I should have looked into it and read the label before buying it on the recommendation of someone.,B07N6JB4FQ,AE3D6GJMTLK4NCP377AXNBXD77KA,2017-08-12 12:30:01.361

4,This product CURED my psoriasis!,I only just began to use the product so I am not able to give a fair rating at this time. In addition this is my first time using He Shou Wu so I have nothing to compare this particular  product too. My intention is to use for at least 6 months before I will make any judgment.  I am  a little disappointed at the  4 oz  size is unavailable. I hope this is only temporary since I was looking to stay with this brand for the full time. I'll look again before I run out if not I'll have to switch brands.,B07GNTYK8T,AEL7DWRSS6FSU2HW3R6NTS3HS7AA,2016-09-10 11:13:55.000

3,Daughter loves it!,"I’ve taken it for almost a month now and the biggest change for me has been my motivation - my lethargy is virtually gone.  Others have commented on the taste - do not let that be the reason you pass on this product.  The taste is very very mild - considering you are getting all of the ingredients, in liposomal form!, without having to swallow 30+ pills a day, and at a fraction of the cost bought individually - this is simply the best biochemical supplement (and I have tried almost everything).  I genuinely give this product my highest recommendation.",B07Q4QFMYL,AGXLTYKO7WKIZ2YE67QYXUHD4XOA,2016-09-14 07:41:40

She was able to easily put it on her arm and secure it without any assistance.  From box to first bp reading was less than three minutes only delayed by having to find 4 AA batteries which are not included but the quality for the price was great.

3,It works BUT!,"living at high altitude it is very dry so it is important to have a cream that will moisturize and yet not be oily. I have been using this cream for over 20 years, have tried others from free samples I have received over the years of much more costly creams and always return to Colonial Dames. Rich and creamy you only need to use a little also the scent is mild and pleasant which is important to me since I am highly allergic to scents and chemicals.

2,Replaced my blood pressure meds.,"Anyone who has Candida, knows how frustrating it is to get rid of. I have literally tried every product out there. I have suffered with Candida for about 6 years now and some products did work a little like Renew Life, but nothing really made a huge difference.<br /><br />I just bought this product and have been taking it for about 4 days now. I started with 3 pills 3x a day because I didn't know how it would affect me.  On the second day, I went to 5 pills 3x on an empty stomach. I've had amazing results just within 4 days!

5,It’s not great,"I'm taking it with piracetam as a nootropic stack. So keep that in mind while you read this review. I've noticed my dreams have become very vivid when I take it before bed. I take it during the day as well and as helped to improve on brain fog. I'm a student and I'm feeling like I'm remembering things a little bit better (could be the piracetam as well). I'm not for sure I'll buy it again yet, but I'll review this after I finish the bag.<br /><br />Other than that, I haven't noticed any other changes. The taste is quite tart, but i just dump it on my tongue and wash it down with OJ or water.<br /><br />The bag is annoying because it never zips closed. Wish they would use better zippers.<br /><br />Edit- 12/11/2017 Still using this same bag. If I need a really good night of sleep I'll take 1 tsp and 1g of Valerian Root. I can sleep 6-7 hours and feel great when I wake up.

3,The Best,"While having my low Vitamin D levels monitored for months, I was taking a prescription for mammoth doses of D2 with no real improvement.

I have been around people sick with the flu and didn't get it, which is very unusual for me.  The pills are a little large, but they are very light, which makes swallowing them easy.  They don't dissolve in your mouth and don't have a taste.  I hear that these are also good for lowering cholesterol and triglycerides, but I haven't had my blood checked lately, so I don't have any evidence that it actually works for that.

5,Great product,"I needed a replacement for an older fitness band that I lost, due to the band detaching from the unit. I wanted a fitness tracker that used the same app (Very Fit Pro), and came with an extra band. I wanted one band to be pink or light color so that it wouldn't stand out when I wear dressier clothing. I also wanted a dark color band so that I wouldn't get stains (common in the reviews for pink bands). I wear the purple band normally and have switched to the pink band for when I dress up. The pink is a  light peachy pink that doesn't stand out against my skin (as much as the purple would). I can even layer a few bracelets near it, which makes it virtually disappear.<br />Also with two bands, the time it takes for the band to loosen (where you detach it to charge it) will be longer. &lt;&lt;&lt;That is the reason I lost my other fitness band.",B07NQ55D5Y,AF46OA5DDISNDZ5X3ADC2XSBVAOQ,2014-07-31 17:20:25.000

2,Taking for CIDP/Auto Immune Disease,I'm giving this to a friend as a baby gift.  There is nothing like waking in the middle of the night to a baby that feels hot to your hand and no way to tell if it's just because your baby has been crying or because the baby is sick.... and sick enough for the doctor or can it wait for morning.  Fevers in little babies are nothing to mess with.  Too high a temperature can cause seizures in a baby....  A thermometer is a piece of mind.  I'd swear too I can never find mine when I need it...,B075TB52N1,AHSCQYFI2WOURNZZKKH3VUDTGMCQ,2012-09-21 14:55:48.000

5,Four Stars,"I switched to this prenatal after another one made me very nauseous. I have been taking these for a week or so and so far I am very happy with this vitamin system. My main concern is getting enough folate (the active form, not folic acid). I also really appreciate the clean ingredient list. Another plus is that I can take this all at once - my other prenatal was multiple times per day. The non-gummy pill is a little bigger than I expected, but not a giant horse pill. I had never taken gummy vitamins before, so I'm not sure if they are all like this but it is not like eating a gummy bear; it is not as chewy. The flavor is good, but there is an aftertaste for me - not a problem but I don't look forward to eating this like it's candy. Overall, I am very happy with this product.",B078SBDGGB,AGNM5NDX63OZBBZZKBY5QFZLP6TA,2017-07-24 00:16:11.925

4,Five Stars,"I purchased this for a friend who I believed could benefit from supplemental magnesium. It arrived promptly and intact, and he seems satisfied with it. I personally use magnesium threonate rather than glycinate, as I seem to need the magnesium particularly in my CNS to counter apparent heavy metal toxicity, and it is my understanding that Mg threonate more easily crosses the blood-brain barrier than other forms of magnesium. Bulk Supplements appears to not offer the threonate form of magnesium as of the time of this review. I would add another star to my rating if Bulk Supplements would throw a Certificate of Analysis (COA) into the deal, as otherwise we're left to wonder where it came from and what impurities (and how much of them) it may contain.",B00AJG6PRC,AEAKORMJZJBYQQWXVQWICGXHMOXA,2015-06-19 01:30:39.000

4,Yum,"I have been taking this pill for nearly a month, and so far I have had good results. I already have thick hair, but it would never grow past a certain point, right around shoulder length. My hair feels noticeably softer and stronger. The drawbacks are that the pills smell terrible, so I hold my breath when I open the bottle and wash them down with plenty of water, and I am very sensitive to biotin so I know my body well enough that I also supplement with vitamin b (pantothenic acid) 2,000 mg along with these hair pills, I would get a very severe acne breakout.

4,Excellent product,"OK.  I have been asked to review this product from Zahler.  This is the 2nd time I've ordered it.  The first time it came in a bottle with a dropper that was a little faulty but seemed to work well enough (the dropper stick repeatedly came out of the rubber top and had to be reinserted before use).  My toddlers drank up their juice with vitamin D drops daily without a problem.  But then they got old enough to move a chair over to the counter where the bottle was stored.  Needless to say, it only takes about 90 seconds of unsupervised toddler time for 2 two year olds to snag a dropper bottle and bite the top off.<br />The second time I ordered the product, there was a new dispensing mechanism that did away with the dropper.  However, it is not as precise as the dropper once was.  Now, I have to give the bottle a quick shake to make a drop (only one??) come out into the glass.  While it is more child-proof, it is less precise.  I don't think it matters as much with vitamin D as it would with other supplements but it is technically a flaw.<br />I'm somewhat satisfied with the product packaging.  Regarding the actual vitamin D, all I can say is that my kids haven't developed rickets.  So I guess it's doing its job.",B016IRQTSU,AFC6GELAFMNIDCVSKFSDK25RYKUA,2016-02-19 18:46:44.000

2,Accurate read every time!,"For people looking for Phytoplankton, this is a good product...But, and this is a big but -- my experience is that it really does not have any effect on your body whatsoever.  What DOES have an effect on your body is the WATER that you drink with it.<br /><br />I tried an experiment. For one week, I took 4 to 6 drops of the phytoplankton with 12 oz of water early in the morning as soon as I woke up - I felt good every morning that week with my mood generally improved.  I thought I had really discovered something.<br /><br />I stopped taking it for a week to see if the effect was real.  That week, my mood was not as good overall.  I was generally more irritable and a bit thirsty throughout the day.<br /><br />I thought maybe the water had just as much of an effect as the Phytoplankton.  To find out whether this was the case, the third week, I took only 12 oz of water with no phytoplankton in it. I felt exactly like I did the first week.  My mood was generally improved. I felt better. And I was more productive at work.<br /><br />My conclusion is that drinking 12 oz of water immediately after waking up makes me feel better, and that the Phytoplankton is just a placebo.  It's possible that this stuff has some real effects for people, but I'm skeptical - I think it is all hype.  The real effect is because of the water you take with it.<br /><br />Don't believe me?...try it for yourself.  It won't cost you anything.

This is so easy to use, an untrained monkey could do it.  The fragrance has a healing scent.  After using this product, my blood test level for vitamin D rose to normal.  I can't say thank you enough to the makers of this cream.  I have bought this and sent it to my daughters and they love it too.  My brother just had blood tests and results came back indicating a severe vitamin D deficiency.  He is so busy he cannot remember to take capsules.

4,Fruit of the Earth Vitamin-E gel has great soothing and moisturizing properties.,"Thank God for this specific product because it actually works and in combination with Thorne Research's Bacillus Coagulans it really kicks it up a notch. I suffered from systemic Candida infection for nearly three decades and it wrecked havoc on every aspect of my life from stability to spirituality. I was depressed, inexplicably weak and melancholy most of the time due to systemic Candida infection. None of the allopathic physicians and most of the naturopathic doctors I went to didn't know what was going on except one doctor in New York City - Dr. Armeni Harris. I went &#34;under the radar&#34; and the doctors begun to think I was crazy because I would constantly tell them something was very wrong with me. Luckily someone was able to correctly diagnose me , but he didn't recommend this specific supplement and I had to find it by myself based on Amazon reviews which helped dearly. Thanks Amazon community!<br /><br />For those who have been suffering for years with Candida I highly recommend Thorne Research's Bacillus Coagulans because if Candida has had its way your probably suffering from &#34;dsybiosis&#34; in your gastrointestinal system. This means if you just take something without taking Bacillus Coagulans probiotic your basically sending it on a suicide mission inside your gut. You need something to balance out the candida overgrowth with beneficial bacterial growth within your gut which can withstand the stomach acids and the hostile environment of your imbalanced gut due to Candida overgrowth. They work best in unison, please watch your diet as well stay away from yeast and sugars if at all possible when you chose to eat. Thanks for your time.<br /><br />February 8, 2017<br /><br />Hello Amazon community, I just found out the root cause of my systemic candida, stomach distress, brain fog, low energy levels, extreme fatigue, breathlessness, and the psychological issues that come along with it. I have &#34;low adrenal function and leaky gut&#34; which was not diagnosed in my youth. This alone has created the environment which candida and all the secondary issues has spread, I am being treated at this time for it. I am still observing LOW MOLD diet (Jill Carnahan)  which can speed up adrenal cortisol recovery with the proper supplements. I have deleted all my other tips because this the &#34;root cause&#34; and if your looking for &#34;adrenal fatigue specialist&#34; I recommend you do it asap especially if you suffer from depression, suicidal tendencies, introverted - lonely behavior, no luster for life and other mental issues created by acute adrenal failure and leaky gut - Restore for gut health really helps (March 4, 2018)<br /><br />Disclaimer:<br />I am not a doctor, herbalist or a alternative physician just someone who cares....",B07R57HXBC,AFLURC23VIBWZ2MPSEEJ5NYTROQQ,2014-07-02 18:01:31.000
4,Total garbage,I was told by Dr to try using for migraines. I have C3-C6 fused in front of neck and C4-T2 fused in back of neck. After the last fusion in back I continued to get migraines at least 2-3x a week. I also have severe back and neck problems since. I take 1 tablet a day 7 days a week. I only get migraines about 3x a month sometimes I get lucky and don't get any. This is much better than before. I would suggest for migraine relief or help. This brand is expensive but well worth it since I've tried cheaper brands at a higher dose and less success. I did research before buying and glad I bought it. Definitely will continue to use and would rather use this than regular dose of prescription meds.,B00F7OZJOQ,AEJT6AYK3PX26QVDXGUIJ7U3PC7A,2021-01-12 07:31:57.184

I am vegan, and have limited resources in my diet for B12. Even with that, my B12 levels got very high...too high, actually. I had to back the dosage down to half every other day.

None of them compare to these. Keep in mind that your body will build a tolerance, so take a couple days of once in awhile, or take as needed. 1 pill worked the first few times I took it, now I find that 2 works great. All 3 at once is awesome but if your like me, you'll want to space them out some.  I usually take 2 in the morning,& 1 more mid afternoon. I have energy all day & ready for bed come night  time.

I feel better, have more energy, and definitely notice when I miss a dose.<br />On the downside, my first bottle contained a sunny yellow liquid that smelled and tasted fairly pleasant.  The three subsequent bottles all contained a more brownish liquid with a smell and taste that varied from bottle to bottle, with the third bottle being a dark brown color and a somewhat foul aroma.  None have given me any ill effects; however, the inconsistency in the product is a bit troubling.",B002VLZ8C6,AHURV3XFRC543MPXBUKQRYZOH6TQ,2022-05-15 00:36:35.331

4,Good taste...bad price.,This stuff is very strong. I started using a tsp a day (not even the full recommend dose on the package) and after a week developed sever nausea and diarrhea. I mean very severe! I stopped taking it for 2 days and I felt better. Then I decided to try it again (just to make sure it was this and not something else).  I started this time at a half a tsp daily. After a few days the nausea came back along with loose stools  but not as bad as before. Also this stuff says it will calm you down. Ya it calmed me down so much all I wanted to do was sleep. I dream a lot now when I sleep.  I also noticed that my nails all of a sudden started to look more shinny.<br /><br />I started taking this hoping to improve my hair but that is still yet to be know.<br /><br />After doing more research on this I realized that this herb needs to be taken with care and even cycled. Meaning don't take it everyday for several months.<br /><br />I'm currently taking it at even a smaller dose as I must be pretty sensitive. This herb also cleans the liver and kidneys so I'm assuming that I have a lot to detox judging by my sever reaction the first time.<br /><br />If anyone else has experienced this I would be very interested in hearing your thoughts.,B07SYNTL34,AH4EHE36JYQEMXHH55IEIOSBDQXQ,2020-10-05 15:50:05.186

4,Love Bulk products and have quite a stock of supplies,"This is a good basic thermometer. It reads very slightly low when used under the tongue or under the arm, but that's really to be expected of any thermometer. The most accurate reading of your internal temperature is to actually measure inside your body, which is rectal. I did two rectal readings within a couple of minutes and got 98.9F and then 98.7F.<br /><br />I love that the tip is soft and flexible. I don't have to worry about hurting my newborn if she moves suddenly while I'm getting her temperature. It took about 10 seconds to get each reading.<br /><br />The only negative thing I have to say about it is all the beeps once it gives the reading. No one needs 10 beeps to notify them that the result is ready. It's really annoying to hear, but turning it off as soon as you see the result is the solution I came up with.",B01J9UYQFG,AH5YTFRXFPMW7VUJQ7KWMDEZFQIQ,2020-11-26 16:17:15.468

About the only answer I see to help with the taste is to buy a capsule filling machine.<br /><br />I have to wonder why various reviewers have totally different takes on the taste - from no taste to baking soda taste to fish sauce taste.  It makes one wonder if the batches are different, and if so, why?  I have bought other supplements from this company and felt they were of excellent quality.  Seeing different answers to the country of origin, supposedly all from the manufacturer, make me question what is going on with this product.

I have used several different ones, most recently Gaia (which is also USDA organic). like most dr best products, this is similar in quality to the best on the market, at about half the price. note that dr best suggests 1.5 g dosage, while Gaia suggest 1.0 g dosage, making dr best quite a bit cheaper at the same dosage. the negative reviews here are all irrelevant, dealing as they do with form rather than substance (and none of these reviewers bothered to look at the photos of the labels).",B07SYNTL34,AHDCVYAPJ3MWUM6W2XJWKROHHF4Q,2020-04-16 16:58:39.674

This doesn't upset my stomach and seems to be easily absorbed into my system without issue.",B09D3DDDD4,AGLLHMKUJHL4IT2KVQV6G3PHKASA,2020-06-02 02:28:35.432

Even if it did come open, the fitbit wouldn't come out on it's own. It's very comfortable and I have gotten some compliments on it.

2,perfect,I had seen a review where the glass had shattered upon the first use but I thought surely it was a fluke. I did use the scale for about one week and just barely tapped it with my foot when walking by it. It instantly shattered and glass went everywhere. I am disappointed that it was so fragile and only lasted a few days before breaking.<br /><br />Update: The manufacturer contacted me about the one star review I left for their product. They immediately refunded my purchase price and shipped me a new scale. The new scale was easier to set up and pair with my phone. It is currently working. I have raised my review to 3 stars. After 45 days if the scale is still working as expected then I will again edit my review and raise to 5 stars based on the excellent customer service I received.<br /><br />The scale has now been working for 45 days and I am both pleased with the product and the customer service I received.,B00412WK1K,AH2XORB5HRFIRCE4MAYXLKXYQWGQ,2015-12-02 15:31:48

4,Five Stars,"This was the only Vitamin D supplement I could get my son to take.  He LOVES the taste of this vitamin D.  However, the price has nearly TRIPLED since I originally purchased it.  I would give this 5 stars for sure if it was priced reasonably.<br /><br />If you're looking for a reasonably priced Vitamin D with the EXACT same taste, I recommend Natural Factors - Vitamin D3 400 IU:<br />https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005UTGPB4/ref=crt_ewc_title_oth_1?ie=UTF8&psc=1&smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER<br /><br />It tastes the exact same as the Franklin and Friends (my son hasn't noticed that I switched).  They look and taste the EXACT same.  As I type this, the Natural Factors is priced at $5.57 (only has 100 tablets - but that is still significantly cheaper than the Franklin and Friends).<br /><br />If the price of Franklin and Friends reduces significantly, I will gladly change my review to 5 stars.",B002VLZ8C6,AH7V7XEFFSN6GHGNYZUWGN6PU3JQ,2016-06-19 13:09:58.000

Sometimes, if I'm running low on time, I fill a few by hand they're less densely packed. This product lets me take fewer pills and they fit neatly in my pill case because they're not too long.

3,Great,"I purchased this item at a deep discount during a promotional period, these are my honest opinions. This is a phenomenal scale, it is very high quality and I am very impressed by it. The instructions clearly told me to install the batteries that came with the scale and once the batteries were in I was able to begin using the scale immediately. I was able to choose either lbs, kgs, or stones.

2,There are much better ones out there!,"Measurements were almost never accurate. I would step on the machine at different times during the day, while clearly drinking or eating more than previously, but the machine would report the same numbers. Even when I would hold items on me, it would give inaccurate reports. It is also important to mention that new batteries did not even last for less than a week on this.

4,Interesting scent,"I felt the effects of this product the same day that I started taking it.  Mainly, my stomach doesn't feel uneasy for most of the day like it used to.  Based on my symptoms, I'm fairly certain I have Candida-related health issues, and after feeling the immediate improvement from this product, I have stronger evidence to confirm my suspicion.<br /><br />Other benefits of this product are that my skin feels better.  It seems more elastic and moisturized.  This is an awesome, unexpected benefit, considering I was having psoriasis-like patches on my eyebrows, elbows, and knees probably due to leaky gut (not fun).  I took this product last year along with a cleansing/experimental diet consisting mainly of greens and veggies, and I remember feeling better than ever.  I've isolated the foods that affect me to dairy(not cheese so much as liquid milk), sugar, and gluten.  Again, these are the foods that would negatively affect a person with candidiasis.  My current experiment is to see how much this product works while maintaining a &#34;regular&#34; diet.  Granted, I'm eating a lot less of these types of foods, but I have to say that this product allows me to eat this stuff in moderation and not feel like crap.  Probably the single-most helpful supplement I've taken, right up there with Saccharomyces Boulardii.",B00Q5CZ3TU,AG7QSRCJFMQGY52TKZ6GNZPWOJSQ,2021-08-26 15:03:07.390

2,I keep several around the house in different rooms..,"My husband and I take Magnesium Powder on a daily basis.  My husband had coronary bypass surgery about 1½ years ago and his cardiologist told him that he needed to take a magnesium supplement, because if he didn't he could have more heart issues, since the body needs the correct balance of magnesium, potassium and calcium.  So, if he didn't get enough magnesium he could experience cardiovascular changes and a rapid heartbeat.<br /><br />This magnesium absorbs easily and it's easy to consume in water or juice, but it doesn't taste that great.  My husband couldn't handle the taste, so I had to get him another brand that had a better taste.  I didn't mind it, so I used it until it was gone.  I probably wouldn't buy it again, since my husband didn't like it.",B00Q71ERRS,AHQ764B4QEMCDFKTEUVFNBSG4A6Q,2013-08-22 14:35:34

3,"Great taste, as usual","This is a great watch for the money but has a design flaw so I would recommend the insurance.  To charge it, you must remove the wrist band.

But the recharging connection broke off due to the issue described above.

3,Extra Strength Capsules,"Everyone has their own taste preferences and what one person may like, another may not. Just as beauty is in the eye of the beholder, palatabilty is a matter for the taster. This particular Genesis Today product for ACAI tastes like a very sweet/tart potent berry flavor candy. I don't notice a strange aftertaste or ""weird"" flavors. It simply tastes like a sweet tart fruit chew, similar to a small block of fruit roll-ups. Another reviewer mentions the orange, goji, and resveratrol flavors as awful, this product is the ACAI and IMO, tastes just great, my husband actually liked it too. Genesis Today actually has FIVE different superchews, perhaps there is one flavor among the five others will prefer over others, or not at all, a matter for each individual taster; remembering each different chew has different properties (mood, energy, cardiovascular, immune system, and joint health). I'm a registered nurse and love the energy/antioxidant properties this ACAI chew provides for me. I don't substitute this item for multivitamins, I take this product along with my daily multivitamin to ascertain my body is well armed with everything I feel it needs. For me, this chew is really tasty, almost like a candy treat and I get energy/antioxidant properties from it to boot, with less calories than a piece of chocolate !!",B00028OOZC,AEK7QQIVHXDAQEPN6AR2GNHF3GFQ,2019-12-24 18:33:08.856

It worked easily and wonderfully for 5 months and then gave an ""oL"" error code and there was nothing else you could do. There is no manual and I see others had the exact same problem.

3,Making a difference,"Have this and the mango fish oil from Barleans. Both taste great with no oil taste. My kids, who are 5 and 7, take this without issue and the 7 year old views it as treat. I like the Barlean's products and with it being fall/winter here in MN it is a good time to order as they stay cool during most of their trip and when out in front of my door. Heat and light can have a big impact on omega's and I think being able to get the Barleans oils cold are a far better way to get your omegas then with pills sold on a shelf. I am an avid weight lifter and have always noticed a great benefit with supplementing with omega's and generally like to get them from both a fish and flax source at the same time. I am hoping the kids will reap the benefits as they grow and develop and these flavored oils are a great way to ensure they get them without complaint.

It didn't magically make the rest of my life better, but the bloating relief was very quick and has lasted over months now.  I don't follow a strict Candida diet but my diet is pretty healthy, and I mostly avoid processed sugars.  I've never thought that a strict Candida diet was particularly sustainable or worth it, but to each their own!  I pair this with a strong probiotic.  It's hard to know which reviews to trust, and I personally am always dubious of reviews that claim a product was entirely life-changing, but I will say that I was impressed how quickly this product started to take effect and how the effects have endured.

2,It is good for you and not in a capsule.,"I have searched for the cure for Candida yeast for several years, this is the best one I've found.<br /><br />This is the essential cure for Candida yeast.  It converts them from their hardened fungus form to their loose yeast form, which allows your body to expel them.  For a complete cleanse avoid alcohol, grains, and sugar while taking this.  Also drink lots of water and sweat in a hot bath or sauna ~1 per day.<br /><br />IMPORTANT TIP: If you have heavy yeast in your throat and down you esophagus like I did, chewing the capsules in your mouth helps a ton.  The formula then coats your throat and breaks up that yeast on it's way down.  If you don't chew the capsules, then the formula will come out in your stomach and only treat the yeast from your stomach onward.",B07M5X9BWL,AHRE2L7LRSAPGKJMZUN42RTMLMZQ,2018-02-25 11:54:36.379

3,Great,"We are 70 years old. Perfect dosage. Those who claim that Melatonin does not work take doses much too high. The latest research advise taking between 0,1 and 1,2 mg before bedtime. I only take 1 capsule (300 mcg = 0,3 mg) and my wife takes 2.<br /><br />I normally fall asleep easily but wake up in the middle of the night unable to sleep again. The time release 6 hours effect is perfect for me. Now I sleep all night long with 1 capsule only.<br /><br />However my wife still have difficulties to fall asleep, and difficulties to wake up.<br /><br />So, I ordered the same Melatonin 300 mcg but Regular, I mean without Time release effect. And my wife will take 1 Regular capsule 300 mcg 1 hour before bedtime and 1 Time release capsule 300 mcg 30 minutes before bedtime.<br /><br />I will tell you if it works better for her when reviewing Regular 300 mcg Melatonin.",B00ZB2JORC,AGYWSUA6E4U3DAXFP32RRWVJV2TA,2016-12-21 00:58:31.000

5,Five Stars,"Great product! Very faint fishy smell, tart taste. I mix it in my morning lemon water and can't tell the taste anymore.  The resealable bag was a bit of a hassle to close every morning when I am in a hurry, due to its thickness, so I ended up poring the contents into a jar instead.

So I know Plant-base is the way to go. I almost didn't purchase this from Amazon because, I thought it had to be refrigerated. The label clearly states refrigerate after opening.  I couldn't ask for faster shipping. I got my purchase in one day. This time around, I'm going to try to measure it out by tablespoon. I use to just go to my fridge and pour it in my mouth, it taste so good. Can't wait to feel the added benefits from the Omega.",B008A0PVM4,AGBYWZOEC5TJYB7MSGOENUTGS7DA,2020-05-30 17:45:03.504

4,Five Stars,This is a great thermometer! It has a quick 10 second read which is perfect for a squirmy baby or an antsy husband who thinks he has a fever.

2,Highly recommend this product!,"I gave this product only one star and felt a definite need to write a review only because the huge amount of five star reviews it received. I always value honest, and to me, there is not a chance that this product would honestly receive so many great reviews. I don't think the product is terrible, maybe a little expensive for how much you get from it, but I only noticed a slight, if any, increase in concentration. An energy shot could do the same.  I was not impressed and would not purchase again.  It sucks that this company is trying to take advantage of us as consumers.",B07SYNTL34,AH6OJRPFPN2OKBO5NOQMQWIQY75A,2019-08-30 13:02:57.533

She said she did nothing that would cause it to stop but she is an 8 year old.  I contacted the company in hopes they would take care of it under warranty.

5,Disappointed,"I've been using this product steadily for at least 6 months and I have to say my hair is looking better and losing less hair then I did before. Also nail strength is noticeably better. I like the time release aspect of this product, taking it once a day is all anyone really wants to do. I'll stick with it, I'm 65 years old and probably true very good genetics I don't have hardly ANY gray hair and I don't know if this is helping but it certainly is not hurting.

2,I like that you don't have to wait for it to ...,"Below you can read my original 1-star review, which I labeled &#34;Inaccurate and Inconsistent&#34;.<br /><br />I have modified this to 3 stars. If used correctly the thermometer can give both accurate and repeatable oral measurements. The secret is understanding what the term &#34;fast&#34; means in the description. It means the time to a fever/no fever determination, NOT the time to an accurate temperature. That is why there are so many reviews complaining about obviously low and inconsistent readings. When the thermometer beeps in 15 seconds or so it does not have an accurate temperature displayed, just whatever measurement was there when it made its fever/ no fever determination.<br /><br />So, to get this to work do the following:<br />1. Put the thermometer in the mouth for 1 minute. Take it out.<br />2. Ignore whatever it says. The purpose of (1) was to warm the device up.<br />3. Wait a minute with the mouth closed. The purpose of this is to let the mouth recover from (1).<br />4. Put the thermometer in the mouth again for a minimum of 60 seconds. Take it out.<br />5. Take the temperature reading.<br /><br />I found the above gave accurate and repeatable measurements compared to both my known reference thermometers and a  temporal artery thermometer.<br /><br />I also want to complement the company's customer service department in their communications with me in response to my first review, as they worked to deal with my comments. They did offer to refund my money (which I am not doing). I would suggest, however, that the marketing materials be modified to be more accurate.<br /><br />**************************************************<br />Original review:<br /><br />I already have two thermometers that have proven accurate (but slow) over the years and was looking for something with a quicker readout. This unit does read out quickly--the sooner to get your wildly inaccurate, inconsistent readings. In general, way too low (oral). If I didn't already have something of known accuracy to compare to I'd be afraid I was sick!",B017DT4HM2,AE3E2OG34WJ2FVYW4SHDX2CCHXTQ,2018-04-17 20:43:53.145

4,Five Stars,I had seen a review where the glass had shattered upon the first use but I thought surely it was a fluke. I did use the scale for about one week and just barely tapped it with my foot when walking by it. It instantly shattered and glass went everywhere. I am disappointed that it was so fragile and only lasted a few days before breaking.<br /><br />Update: The manufacturer contacted me about the one star review I left for their product. They immediately refunded my purchase price and shipped me a new scale. The new scale was easier to set up and pair with my phone. It is currently working. I have raised my review to 3 stars. After 45 days if the scale is still working as expected then I will again edit my review and raise to 5 stars based on the excellent customer service I received.<br /><br />The scale has now been working for 45 days and I am both pleased with the product and the customer service I received.,B002VLZ8C6,AFHU7RLJZSNZUF7OCR33VVQIU32Q,2014-09-08 20:49:12.000

4,I order these all the time,"Generally spirulina is a blue-green algae that contains B vitamins, vitamin E and other minerals.  When I recieved this product the label only states that it contains fiber, vitamin A, iron and sodium that is why I gave this product only 3 stars. I have since purchased another brand from amazon (Pure Hawiaan) and the label states that it contains Vitamin A, K, B12, iron, mag, potassium, maganese, chromium, and 2 grams of protein.  Not sure if this difference has anything to do with the way companies process product or not, but if I am going to use spirulina I would rather use the one which has the most nutritional value.<br /><br />I only used this product for about a week before I switched over to the other brand so I cannot really comment on its effectiveness. I would advise before buying spirulina product to make sure you read the label.  You can look up the product on another website, such as vitaminshoppe, to actually view the label.<br /><br />Otherwise, fast delivery from this seller",B07RP2S9F3,AFRSEFJ77F47CSFVKFWQVIZ44YKQ,2020-05-12 18:59:48.394

4,Inaccurate,"Magnesium Glycinate is a much less harsh alternative than either the oxide or citrate; if you have ever had to supplement magnesium, this should be your choice.  My reason was taking proton inhibitors - they deplete magnesium, which in turn affects mood, and a whole class of other symptoms.  The glycinate form has less impact on the gut.  In fact, the citrate form is used as a purging agent.  Bulk supplements is a low cost alternative to buying OTC magnesium, which is often hard to get in a preferred factor.

Leave on 5-20 minutes, then shower and wash my hair.  Fantastic and is one of the things I am doing that is slowly restoring color to my gray hair.  Aloe is an astringent.  Great before a shampoo.  Vitamin E is an anti-oxidant which, imo, reduces hydrogen peroxide buildup on the scalp.  Hydrogen Peroxide causes gray hair.  Skin in distress produces hydrogen peroxide as part of the immune response.  Also getting rid of dead skin on the scalp lets oxygen get to your hair follicles.",B017DT4HM2,AGEXBSPVAWB23S6U5IXK43P3OX5Q,2017-07-16 04:10:49.911

The 1 thing I really DISLIKE is the constant vibration all day long & I've not been able to figure out anyway to change it or better yet STOP IT!!<br />For the price I think this is a good watch.

5,Five Stars,ORIGINAL REVIEW 05/05<br /><br />So Far Vast Improvement Over Fitbit Flex.<br /><br />The customer service for the his company is amazing. I had an issue and I contacted them and they are addressing the issue promptly and to my satisfaction.  I would definitely buy from this tracker again if and when the opportunity arises.<br /><br />Original Review<br />My partner purchased several Fitbit devices. Each one broke.  I like things simple so I got the flex.  Which was fine. But I hated to lot on to get my steps and everything else.  With this I can check steps and do so much more at a fraction of the cost.  It looks great and the notifications are awesome too.<br /><br />I have a Google Pixel 2 and have no issues with connecting to the device.,B01NCLOJFY,AGUBNVK6RNTYBZJZ7FSVM4SEIDLQ,2021-03-01 22:26:02.708

3,Two Stars,Different weight (but within 5 pounds) depending on where in the bathroom I place the scale. I could've guessed the range; I'd expect more accuracy. I'm thinking if I always weigh myself in the same approximate spot it'll give me an idea about whether I'm increasing or decreasing day to day. This is below the expected standard for a bathroom scale tho :),B075Y6DQFL,AGOKDECWIAIKAXUJH4Y2Z5KPJ2IQ,2020-02-12 14:07:47.286

I couldn't believe it myself but the proof was right in front of me. It smells really nice and she didn't react to it at all. I plan on using this product on my boyfriends cracked heels to see if it helps with that. I would highly recommend this product for anyone with cracked skin or issues with skin. I wouldn't use is on personal areas due to it being a lotion and also due to the scent, that is the reason I had ordered it to use for a herpes outbreak but found out it wouldn't work for that afterwards.

4,High inaccuracy + Bad tracking.,"I should have heeded the negative reviews.  I bought this flour a few years ago and it was great.  The moment I opened the sealed can and sniffed, I knew something was wrong with it  it didn't smell at all like chestnuts.  It smelled like plastic or something rancid.  i went ahead and cooked a few Italian pancakes (necci) with it anyway, hoping the odd smell would cook out, but it did not.  They tasted very bitter and nasty. Threw them away.  A non-returnable item, and not cheap!  Glad I did not spend more.  From now on i will look for another brand.

The powder also doesn't dissolve/mix very well with anything unless it's warm so I wouldn't recommend adding to cold drinks without blending because it will stick to the bottom of the container. I have however noticed that it makes me feel a little nauseous from time to time when taking in larger doses after a spree of unhealthy eating. That tells me it must be combating toxins in the system. I will follow up and comment at a later date.",B002VLZ8C6,AEIECY4NXXZHPQ4DH6CIBXZD3NOQ,2013-11-05 11:39:39.000

3,Quality Multi-Vitamin!,"This is super moisturizing cream, that is absorbed quickly and doesn't irritate my sensitive skin. I use it as a general moisturizer for my hands and face. It leaves my skin feeling really soft and healthy looking. The effects seem to last for quite a while and the longer you use it the better the results, I have found.<br /><br />I first came across this cream when looking for something to cure my dad's eczema on his hands. The tips of his fingers had long deep splits in them and were incredibly painful for him. I happened across someone who advised using this propolis cream in conjunction with the Forever Living Aloe Vera juice [[ASIN:B00137JS3O Forever Aloe Vera Gel, 33.8 oz]]. You drink an 'egg cup' (about 2 tablespoons) twice a day and rub on the propolis cream. This cleared up my dad's eczema within a few days. Way more effective than the doctor's steroid creams. Later on, when his eczema came back, we tried just the cream on its own. It did work - but not as quickly or as effectively as doing the drink and the cream together. In the past we have also tried other brands of aloe vera cream and drinks - but they have not been as effective - so on this product I am brand loyal. After a couple of rounds of this, my dad's eczema disappeared completely and has never returned. Many years later, he experienced very dry skin on the palms of his hands as a side effect to taking some medication. The skin was literally peeling off in big sections. Once again, the doctor prescribed steroid cream that had no effect. He went back to the propolis cream and aloe vera drink and again within a few days his condition cleared up.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this cream generally and in combination with the Forever Living aloe vera  drink for anyone with eczema or other skin conditions.",B017DT4HM2,AFQZCPDSEEJIS77VWUXHOV7ARVYA,2016-08-21 15:06:04.000

I took a half scoop first just to see how it felt. 60 minutes later I was calmer, happier, more focused and motivated, and that feeling lasted all day. I didn't even take the night dose. It tasted great especially considering all the nutrients combined in it. I've tried other powdered combo supplements and they're all mixed with artificial colors and flavors, which I hate the taste and also the nasty unhealthy chemicals in my body.

Unfortunately, the same exact thing happened with scale #2 - it stopped working AGAIN after 3 months of use. I am very upset as I can't return either since they both broke as soon as the return period ended.

This is an excellent Vit C and does not hurt my stomach even when I am mega dosing when sick.  Not suggesting that this is an alternative to getting a yearly flu shot, but this is my flu shot in capsule form and it is also my common cold shot (if there were such a thing) in capsule form.

2,Worth buying,"I started taking this supplement per the recommendation of my naturopath and her hope that it would help curb suspected high estrogen levels and debilitating periods.

It's a bit spendy, but much better than buying the fish-oil pills and putting up with fishy burps all day.<br /><br />I like to put my teaspoon's worth in my morning oatmeal, but it tastes good by itself. It may actually taste too good—it's tempting to have an extra spoonful or two, with the result being that a bottle doesn't last as long as it should. But again, it's better than putting up with that fishy taste from fish-oil pills.<br /><br />I recommend not purchasing online, however. My order from Amazon arrived in one of those plastic envelopes with the bubble-wrap lining; this offered next to no protection of the contents. When I opened the package, the cap was cracked, and the seal had been punctured. Fortunately, Whole Foods is just a block away, so I was able to return it with no problem.

2,Five Stars,"Just a really quick review to share my (unique?) experience:<br /><br />Taste: No problem, especially considering you're drinking vitamins! I honestly expected the taste to be worse than it is. You just shoot it down - Don't let it touch the sides of your mouth, the insides of your cheeks, et cetera and it's fine. It doesn't even taste that bad using this method.<br /><br />Results: Excellent! During the 1st two+ weeks: I saw substantial and very noticeable improvement overall. I felt great! Energy level was up I was happy as could be with this product. I could hardly believe how lucky I was to find it!<br /><br />Then the bad news: Somewhere around the 3rd week Of taking these vitamins, I developed this unexplainable kidney pain.<br />Just both my kidneys hurt all the time , to the point where I was practically hunched over. It was not fun (and a little scary to be honest). Now I drink nothing but bottled water all day long — lots of it. Been drinking lots of bottled water for years now...<br />I figured that the only thing it could be from was the vitamins — so I stopped taking them right away....<br />In less than a week the kidney pains subsided, until they were completely gone.<br />But my energy, and general feeling of well being that I got in the 1st two weeks is also gone. 😢<br />1st 2 Weeks: I feel amazing!<br />3rd Week: I feel like I'm going to croak from kidney failure.<br /> As crazy as it sounds, I'm thinking about giving it another shot... Hopefully, I'll be able to report on here as to exactly what happens?<br />If the kidney pain starts again I'll just stop it - For good this time.",B00NP759OM,AFF6QROMN4WLFURURIRJNCYL7J2A,2020-06-24 17:30:56.353

We bought them to help supplement my husband’s deficiencies in his diet as well as to boost his immune system. Can’t say for sure it’s this product BUT since he started taking them 3 mos ago he looks A LOT better and feels a bit different with his overall fatigue, etc.<br />4 stars out of 5 only because there’s really not a definitive way to measure the products efficacy re: my husband’s improvements we’ve seen.

I can tell you when your body starts getting rid of the toxins, you don't feel too spiffy!  You have a host of side effects.  It took a couple of days, but I could definitely see a difference in how I felt.  It seem to take the strain off my liver from all the toxins my body was releasing and calmed the side effects.  It doesn't happen overnight but you will eventually see a difference.  I am most certainly feeling better after taking these.  I take one in the morning and one in the evening as recommended.<br />  Here are some  benefits you can expect......<br /> Trikatu helps in gastric cleansing and improves digestion and absorption<br />Trikatu supports the respiratory system by promoting health lung function and normal breathing.<br />Trikatu promotes normal blood circulation<br />Trikatu improves metabolism and helps in weight management<br />Trikatu provides excellent support during the winter months<br />Very happy with purchase!

3,Tastes great,"Super lightweight, barely know it's there. My last one felt like it was 5x heavier. The tracker also sits well on the wrist.<br /><br />I love the secure strap with the secure loop which has a nib that clicks into one of the watch holes.  I am pretty sure I lost my last tracker because it didn't have this feature and the strap got caught on something and fell off.<br /><br />The sleep tracking isn't great but it is nice to have even if it's pretty inaccurate.  Would be great if, within the veryFitPro app to confirm the sleep range like in my Samsung Health. Additionally I think it's less accurate than my Samsung Health. It's a little disappointing to see over 15% less steps on the tracker when i wear it 24/7 vs my Samsung Health phone app which is on a device I am not carrying on me 24/7. However changing it to my dominant arm did bring the tracked steps around 5% more than my cell phone.<br /><br />The tracker doesn't start counting if less than 10 steps is detected. It also will deducting steps/zeroes out steps if it thinks you moved less than 30 steps.  I have also noticed sometimes the steps don't increase even when walking like the pedometer has frozen.<br /><br />I don't plan to use it for an alarm or for calls. I haven't checked out the SNS alerts,  Frankly because most times I have my phone within reach if I am stationary.<br /><br />The touch screen is pretty good.  There's a little oval on a side of the tracker which will turn the screen on if it's out and flip through the stats.<br /><br />Instructions could also be a bit better in the app...",B07NYR6PN1,AGPNDPRMGYJXIW5H7V2DONIOPZ7A,2021-01-09 04:18:14.604

There were a few reviews that said it didn't beep or that it was quiet. Not true, it beeps LOUDLY and not just once, it beeps TEN TIMES when it's done taking your temperature. Definitely not what I was looking for. To top it all off, the thermometer is non-refundable. Waste of $11.",B00B7FQNH6,AE22EF57IWBRYFUCRPUY7NUT2H5Q,2019-03-31 23:08:57.262

3,Is everything advertised and easy to use,"Good: these multivitamins seem to be working. I just started taking them this past week, but I can feel a slight difference in my energy levels. I like that I only need to take 1 pill per day unlike other brands that require 3x a day. They're gel capsules and that makes it easier to swallow, which is really necessary because they are really big compared to other brands and vitamins. The seller's picture/ad for these vitamins show that it's about the size of a penny; I just measured the pill here in-person and it's roughly the diameter of a quarter. Other than that, it's fine.",B00EIS9NTY,AGZW2Y2GINABNBPUA4ZM24C36TEA,2017-10-08 18:14:19.123

5,looks great,"My wife and I love these! For the price, you are getting a complete multivitamin regiment for less than a dollar-a-day.<br />We are very active people doing kayaking and bicycling in the summer, and snowboarding/skiing, hiking in the winter. We are also year-round runners and do challenging yoga almost every day (you gotta relax on the weekend c'mon). We have both noticed a difference in taking these vitamin packs in our skin and nails, as well as our recovery time from exercise, and just a better overall healthy feeling. You can call that a placebo effect if you want, but the science in these is also something I like to research before I buy vitamins. They are all suspended in sunflower oil in capsules - which not only is a better delivery system for the vitamins to be absorbed by your body (take it from me I'm a NURSE), but sunflower oil is also more completely broken down by your body - I remember that from my biochem class, look it up you will see the full explanation!<br /><br />Anyway - they are great vitamins, take the place of a whole bunch of individual pills you could take, and I have never gotten a broken pack. If you read some of the negative reviews they are only negative because the item arrived damaged - not that the vitamins were a bad product (so not really a reason to leave a bad review for the product, more like the seller or shipping fault)<br />I hope VPX keeps making these and does not focus solely on BANG energy drink - they make a lot of other good products with solid science behind them.",B07VHGX6C7,AHE2CBYSPN4YPSNYJELYXWPPZBUA,2015-12-12 23:10:28.000

This thermometer consistently read 96.4 to 96.8 when then VICKS was reading 98.2.  I tested several family members with similar results.  BOTH of the Best Digital thermometers I purchased had similar consistently low readings suggesting that this is a factory calibration problem.<br />For individuals relying on accurate measurements to determine whether they are running a fever, this is a potentially dangerous assessment tool.

5,Weird design,"It generally works pretty good, but it's not as waterproof as I understood it to be. It doesn't seem to be bothered by washing hands, but it lost the ability to charge after being submerged a couple of inches a few times.

4,Excelente combinación de vitaminas,So the reviews comparing the different magnesium forms say this is the one to get if you don't want to get the runs.  Before wiht MgCO I could take 3 grams and I'd be on the edge of the runs.  Same with this.  Not happy about that.  Also had I known this stuff was sooo horrid tasting (MgCO has no flavor) I would not have bought the powder form.  Ultra mega yucky.  I've been forced to hand capsulize these just so I can get them down.  Seriously considering throwing it out because it's such a pain.,B00XA9ZJVI,AEQXRY5XK5UI5A5362SBS7U4KSJA,2015-06-20 16:38:37

4,I am happy with my purchase do far,The nutrition on the bottle is really good but you have to take 4 capsules which makes it only a 30 day supply.  I would consider it overpriced for what it is.  I do like that it is gluten free and they do a one for one donation.,B017DT4HM2,AFLOI53FHTXGLEHNYUNV5OPPOIXA,2020-10-19 19:19:51.419

4,Has all the essential vitamins needed for the seasoned male.,"yes, it is tablets__like practically all spirulina on the market. I have used several different ones, most recently Gaia (which is also USDA organic). like most dr best products, this is similar in quality to the best on the market, at about half the price. note that dr best suggests 1.5 g dosage, while Gaia suggest 1.0 g dosage, making dr best quite a bit cheaper at the same dosage. the negative reviews here are all irrelevant, dealing as they do with form rather than substance (and none of these reviewers bothered to look at the photos of the labels).",B07MKGM64W,AF5IQPNVCK47JGBYQXL6M4A6EQ6A,2017-01-16 15:05:49.000

4,High quality powder supplement packaged well,"I've run the gamut of energy and focus supplements, but few have had such consistent effects as Elebra. The clean, straight-forward packaging on the outside is a direct reflection of what's on the inside: a nice clean focus-enhancement supplement. I found my best dose at 2 capsules with no caffeine, but found that if I needed the extra boost, I could take three (the recommended dose) with or without caffeine, both to great effect. The additions of rhodiola and various vitamin b supplements, I think, is what really makes this blend special.<br /><br />Often times, after a have a dose or two of a certain focus supplement, I feel the effects start to lessen, until there's really none at all. I took Elebra every two-three days for about three weeks (again, at various doses) and always felt the intended boost (which, of course, varied by the dose, when I took it in the day, how tired I was when I took it, etc). It's really increased my productivity, and I was able to get several looming projects completed that had been hanging over my head for weeks (take that, disorganized closet!).<br /><br />Not all supplements are for every one, but this one is definitely worth giving a shot.",B002VLZ8C6,AHU255PM7YGE4SDDDUT5IACWSJGA,2019-11-12 04:31:03.676

I wouldn't need to do that had i bought a digital scale with large display digits.  it's also not clear enough, when black numerals are displayed on top of dark metallic color.  It is placed near the sink in the bathroom, which doesn't get enough bright lights to see the numbers more clearly.<br />I do like the aspect of not needing a battery though.",B006IB8L3I,AE6RFBLPBTMBF2EDSU6YWHVOWSLA,2016-04-03 19:16:18.000
4,Doesnt work for long,"This stuff is really delicious and good for you. Its thick, moist, warmly spicy, mildly sweet and is just loaded with layers of flavors both familiar and exotic. I can't say I have yet noticed specific benefits of using it, but in the range of possible food choices, this one tastes great, soothes an upset stomach, and is a healthy choice for a treat. A teaspoon of this after meals satisfies my craving for sweets and does a significant job of making the taste in my mouth really nice. I was thinking this would a be a delicious filling for a sophisticated fruit biscuit cookie, like those flat cookies filled with pureed raisins, or maybe even as a filling for Rugelach. The Darbur brand is good quality and not as sweet as some other brands (but not at all bitter, either). Spread on toast in the morning with some tea!

5,Love this product,"I have psoriasis, particularly bad on my elbows.  I have tried everything from tanning to topical meds to OTC stuff to biologics.  I have been using this cream along with my topical steroids for a few weeks, and I believe it does augment the medicine.  I am also on Humira, which helps some, but does not take all the crusting away.  With this cream, my elbows are starting to feel like real skin again.  I don't think it does much on its own for me, but it does seem to be a great addition to the meds and make them work even better.",B0037M6UWK,AE6F33RJA6VW4AM6I5GLFU4EXVHQ,2019-12-30 03:34:45.698

1,Smells good,"I am a big fan of Bulk Supplement products and have used their magnesium citrate and calcium products for years.  A friend of mine suggested trying magnesium glycinate and taking it before bedtime.  It stabilizes the nervous system and the amino acid glycine has a calming effect on the body.  Magnesium glycinate is composed of magnesium, an essential mineral, and glycine, a non-essential amino acid that helps ease absorption by the body.  This form of magnesium is also less likely to cause a laxative effect.  Offered as a powder, Bulk Supplements' products do not have fillers and provide extremely good value.  I take 1/4t - 1/2t in 8 oz. of water before bed and my sleep quality has greatly improved to where I actually feel rested when I wake up in the mornings.",B00GBBW848,AH2Q3JETSMS56YCBZN3FSL4WD5TQ,2018-03-15 17:47:00.079

4,I purchased many years ago when I had a rash ...,So I did some research on this stuff for prematuring gray hair. And it's highly recommended so I found it here on good o Amazon at a great price. I've been drinking it in my coffee - totally love it in coffee- for a few weeks. I have a bit more energy through out my day. I had surgery on my ankle and it has stayed swollen since the surgery and after drinking on this my swelling has gone down tremendously. As for as the bit of gray I have that I'm trying to get reversed is still in review. From what I've researched and was told it takes a couple of months of being consistent with it to see the difference so I will hopefully get back to you guys with an update.<br />I have noticed however this.... My hair grows fast and after dying my hair I would start to see gray hair coming in about 2weeks after I dyed my hair. 😕. Not good for me I just turned 30. So after buying this Ho Shou Wu i did dye my hair about 3 days after being on it the tonic(My gray was very noticeable so I dyed it) Anyway I've been drinking the tonic for about 5 weeks now FAITHFULLY and I have not had to redye my hair yet. I do see couple of gray hair now but it's not so bad that I need to dye it again.,B017DT4HM2,AEKI4V7KIFNQPPJHYWDKOBBYKD2Q,2020-11-17 00:34:46.188

2,Five Stars,"This is (by far) the best thing I've found to control my severe systemic candida.  I ran out for a few days & was trying something else, & my candida returned immediately.  I tried using this a year ago (2 caps 3 x per day) & quit, thinking that it didn't work.  I have suffered with this condition for over 30 years, MD's were totally useless, they gave me multiple antibiotics (which worked VERY temporarily (maybe a couple of weeks), pain killers, sleeping pills, anti-inflamatories, & muscle relaxants (which masked the symptoms while on the drugs only).  It wasn't until I saw a naturopath & was diagnosed immediately with candida, was I able to finally start getting it under control.<br />I actually cured myself once (in a week!) with plain garlic (3 - 4 cloves throughout the day - cut up & swallowed like little pills)  I just took a clove every time I noticed any itching.  Unfortunately, I went nuts eating sugar right away & just took a clove of garlic to stop any symptoms starting to come back.  After going through a very stressful month along with my old (sugar) diet, my candida came back with a vengeance!  It's now resistant to garlic & I've been diagnosed with a sensitivity to it as well!  I was desperate to find something that would work as the candida was spiraling out of control.  I browsed Amazon looking for something that was highly rated & came across people raving about SF722.  I still had some, so I decided to  try it again, & this time I took the full dose, (5 caps 3 x per day) & it worked!  I've since added genestra black walnut on the advice of my ND & it is definitely keeping the candida at bay.  I'm now looking to find a good detox for heavy metals as I've been diagnosed with a toxic load of, probably due to many amalgam fillings (which I've since had removed).<br /><br />2/23/2015  Update!  I got rid of the candida again, this time with asparagus!  I ate some every day, either in my smoothie (3 - 4 stalks) or fried some up in a little butter with some pink salt (YUM!).

3,Feels just like the real Fitbit 2 bands,"For my 17 year old daughter. This is her second box, and she actually got it for her hair. Her friend said that while it didn't happen overnight ...her friends hair grew stronger and longer.<br />My daughter's hair is fried from the 'flat iron'. And though she's used quality products on the outside of her hair, I've always read that good hair begins ""inside"" the scalp and body. As a normal teenager, she doesn't have the best of diets. I do what I can about the vegetables and fruits, but you know how that goes.<br />Could be our imagination, but her hair DOES seem a bit thicker, not as much breakage, and definitely looks smoother. Her nails are most definitely not 'peeling' and thin.<br />Received the product super fast and in mint condition. There are flat foil packets in the box. Each packet has about a months worth of pills and the days of the week are marked at the top of each packet. You 'punch' the pill out through the foil on the back of the packet.<br />Could I get a $4.00 bottle of plain Biotin at the drugstore? Sure. But she carries the little flat foil packet in her wallet which is convenient. And packaged this way makes them more 'special' in her mind, so she remembers to take them. Unlike her vitamins.",B015QLFIXQ,AFILJGP3MZODYSK5CJCUKHZ56QGA,2017-05-15 15:46:30.000

3,Love it,"Product arrived quickly and was as advertised.  I'm on my forth month of taking this supplement.  This brand has less clumping when added to hot water, than the other brand I was using, but the ratio is different. So I buy both and blend them.

2,Delivered as promised,"I have an autistic daughter who's super picky with food. I was giving her drops in her juice water, but I wanted something that she would just eat and not take all day to finish. She hates gummies but loves chocolate so I tried these. The first time I gave her one she spit it out....i think she was hoping it had Kit Kat flavor. The second time, she ate it....and every day since.

4,not accuracy,"These were recommended to me by a nutritionist at the hospital. My daughter was undergoing chemotherapy and did not want to eat anything. She really did not like the flavor of any of the dairy type drinks. However, she really loved these drinks. She said they tasted &#34;sort of like kool-aid&#34; and was able to drink them frequently. I think she also liked that they looked like juice boxes. She was in first grade at the time, so having something that looked familiar and felt familiar to her seemed to help convince her to give them a try. In the end, she was able to maintain enough weight so she did not have to get a feeding tube, and this product was a big part of the reason why.",B002VLZ8C6,AHIMLJ55DQVOXYGDK5NWWI3Y3OQA,2019-04-08 14:07:16.838

I tried it for a week to see if the reaction would go away, but it did not.<br /><br />I'm throwing out the rest and just going back to pill vitamins. I would not recommend this. The only allergy I know of is kiwi, so I have no idea was causes the reaction. My advise is not to gamble on this.

They sent out a replacement in less than a week.  I wish more companies stood behind their products this well.,B078SBDGGB,AHR2CCBDFP7LBDEJ4BUESH63UKSA,2020-06-20 17:03:34.092

5,Five Stars,"First of all, I love this product, people I have recommended this too are now forever obsessed. However, I  noticed the product I recently ordered has a few differences so I am a little worried. One thing, the shape of the base of  container is different than the ones that I have purchased. The second, the scent is unfamiliar, it has always had a funny smell but this is a different scent. And lastly, the product is not thick as all the ones I have bought in the past. This has a very thin texture feel. I will put an update in a few weeks to see if the results are the same as always. Crossing my fingers! I hope this is not a fake.<br /><br />Update: So the product is not as effective. I had finally had someone bring me the original from our of state and we all saw major differences. So needless to say I will not risk ordering from here again. Maybe I was just one of the unlucky ones that got a bad batch but if I have to I will just bring some from out of state because the real product has the best results. If you live in California just go to your nearest rite aid and you will find it there.",B07MNM99HG,AGNWQTBC5GVA5LET5JB44RWU3VXQ,2015-10-10 17:50:40.000

However when you get the product, the dosage is 2 per day to equal 10,000, so it's actually ore expensive than it's competitors.  But the worst thing is the fat jar which is very difficult to open.  I would assume most people taking this supplement are older as  am I.  I also have arthritis and I had to transfer these to another container.  Not happy.

4,Bad Taste,"I have been taking Appearex Biotin Tablets for quite some time now and I would have to give it an excellent review.  It really is the only supplement that has helped my nails grow long and fairly strong.  Finally a product that lives up to it's claims!  I had previously tried other supplements, creams and polishes.  You name it, I probably have tried it.  My nails aren't super strong but they are long and not splitting or peeling.  It really isn't that expensive as I get it on the Amazon subscribe and save. You have to give it time to work as it takes months for a complete nail to grow out.  It doesn't seem to have the same effect on the toenails though.  Anyway, I am fully satisfied with this product and I highly recommend it.",B01A7HG78Y,AG6VWOWM3CYENEV3JQPRVTKZOAFQ,2016-11-11 15:23:31.000

1,They fit great and the girls love the color selection,"Beautiful, almost flat scale. Arrived quickly and works great. Only prob was locating the battery compartment, since there was no diagram in the instructions. It's on the side, by the way!",B00VWID4YS,AEANWMD4TVXBZIWQYK6MQJYFIKBQ,2021-05-30 17:46:16.574
4,Five Stars,"I'm taking this because I was having heart palpitations.  After a few days I stopped having them and haven't had them since.  I mix the powder in my first cup of coffee with cream but I'm only taking a smidgen instead of the least recommended dosage to stop the heart palpitations.  But, that zipper on the bag that it comes in is a joke.  I couldn't zip it so I'm using a long bag clip on the bag to seal it.",B002BQ3EHM,AFDL5RLA5YBL66LTQOSTCHK57JPA,2021-04-24 22:16:04.450

4,It's okay,This is a product you must have on hand to shorten any illness. Everyone in my office had the flu for 7-14 days.  When I started getting sick on a Friday I took this and was fine by Monday.  Also shared a bottle with my sister when she couldn't kick the flu for a month - she was starting a third round of antibiotic and I gave her a bottle to try before she did- guess what ? She kicked it with this product.  I love it.,B000FGXMWC,AFK6RLOYUHGZYVXZ4R4JATEA32WQ,2022-01-20 14:10:29.937

3,Can't live without this stuff,"I never really stuck to the entire take a tablet one or two times a day thing, I was never consistent in taking this, yet I still noticed a huge difference in the fullness of my hair. My barber noticed a lot too, which genuinely surprised her. When I told her what I was taking she started recommended it to her other clients and so far there has been more positive feedback from it. For myself, I didn't noticed any immediate results, even a couple weeks in. You never notice the small changes over time, so it was the combination of my barber asking me why my hair is thicker, and seeing then seeing my head from a rear view on a security camera one day. It was pretty nice seeing the results, and I'm sold on using this product now!",B01A90FMHQ,AE2AUMODZLMXAH6OCEFXJMQWBHBQ,2020-01-27 04:34:06.223
1,good scale,Swanson Vitamins are the best and very competitive on price. We use the celery seed to reduce night cramps and needed some quickly so we ordered through Amazon.

3,did not work for me.,I like the organic aspect and the purity and the taste.  The packaging doesn't work- the product clumps up into cement that then has to be hydrated to a goop to use.

If you are suffering from candida symptoms (and I'm not talking about just your regular yeast infection -- I'm talking all over the body-type candida symptoms, like foggy thinking, bad breath, fatigue, sores in mouth, etc) you must give this product a try. I've been taking it for only 6 days and I'm feeling so much better already. I'll post an update if anything changes -- but as far as I can see, this product is a keeper.

1,Good if you are deficient in Folate,"The product has more than lived up to expectations.  I have found extra energy I didn't think I'd ever get back after 3 brain surgeries. I have found, having taken one full bottle earlier and needing more, that my energy level can border on &#34;hyper&#34; at times, so I have learned to cut back to 1 capsule every other day, sometimes every 2 days.

1,I used it after surgery on my hands.,I have been on the search for the perfect woman's multivitamin with the right amount of nutrient from a whole food source. The quality and amount of supplements you put into your body really matters. You want nutrients the body recognizes as food. I've been taking these vitamins for almost a month now and the first thing I noticed my body felt good again I felt healthy and happier. I had more energy that matched an outside glow. I actually felt I could do anything. Simply this is one of the best multivitamins I have ever taken and will continue to take forever.,B07NYR6PN1,AHQSDP7A7UH53FW3XOZXY67UNYKQ,2014-10-21 04:28:57.000

5,A must for Candida killin,"I bought a 4oz package and I've just about used it up in 6 weeks, I have another package coming in 2 weeks and I'll probably have used the last of this before it gets here - it'll be close.  I don't know if there has been any change in grey hairs yet but I absolutely notice a difference in the thickness of my hair.  I've always had baby fine hair (lots and lots of hair but super fine and it breaks easily - limp and lifeless) and my hair is feeling much thicker and has some body to it.<br />At first the taste seemed burnt - it reminds me of something very familiar that I can't quite place (I think it reminds me of the smell of cordite after shooting guns).  But underneath the burnt smell/taste it is quite sweet and sticky if you get it moist.  I've actually come to enjoy the taste of it.",B003CFB2CU,AFQ57QOALHAV4ZLUGEMDP44YFTXQ,2013-08-19 13:39:37.000
3,Nice & Rich Flavor,"This stuff is great!! I read an article online that recommended this brand of Gui Pi Wan - a.k.a &#34;Bring back the spleen.&#34;  I read other reviews of another brand sold on Amazon where folks were concerned about the talcum it contained. I don't know whether that's warranted or not but this brand doesn't contain talcum.  Anytime I've gone to a Chinese Doctor in the past 15 years, he/she always comments that I have spleen deficiency. And I've studied acupressure so I know that the teeth marks that ring the outside edge of my tongue indicate spleen dampness. I was given too many antibiotics as a child and apparently they are very hard on the spleen.  I love these pills. About 5-10 minutes after taking 6 of these little tea pills an amazing calm comes over me. I am hoping in time they will strengthen my spleen and cure my insomnia. If you take the recommended dosage (24-30 pills/day), one bottle won't last very long. About a week.  So if you try them and like them and want to stock up, better prices can be found on other websites.  Shipping is more expensive but pays for itself with a 6-8 bottle order.  Very happy with this seller (Solstice Medicine Co.).",B002VLZ8C6,AGQWBVCQGFLNTK26BCT3RKDOA2XQ,2015-11-25 09:12:04.000

3,Reliable Seller,"I’ve been having major issues for over a year now- bloating, constant upset stomach, weird feelings like itchinesss or that I swallowed soap- I went to countless doctors who gave me antibiotics and all sorts of things which made it worse, and finally one doctor told me I had a fungal infection and gave me an anti fungal which was one dose and did next to nothing… after lots of self-research I found this product and realized I may have a very bad case of candida, and have been taking it for 3 days now (3 pills 3 times a day per the advice of other reviews) and feel AMAZING. If you have any of these symptoms or feel that somethings off, ignore western doctors who will just prescribe you pills for the wrong thing, and BUY THIS!!! Cannot suggest it enough and it’s only been THREE DAYS. Can’t wait to see how I feel after a few weeks…literally… BUY THIS.",B009SZXM5I,AGLPOJMBASVR7R6MRV5A7U566HYA,2016-11-25 04:14:54.000

4,Five Stars,"This extract is amazing! I have tried four other brands of He Shou Wu, and this is by far the best one I have come by. It is great to take before meditating, and I feel it helps my sleep more than any other herb I take. The taste seems to get better and better with time, signifying the how much the body wants it. This is one of my favorite herbs, and this is my new favorite vendor to get it from.<br />  The health benefits have been great. My body/mind feels more vibrant and connected after a month or so of use. I feel a deeper level of energy through out the day. I think this is a great herb to start with in the field of tonic herbs, but I think people should start with a lower concentration to really understand how great this specific product is. Out of the adaptogens I use, this one is probably the number one herb I would use for stress relief and sedation. Where ever you are at hormonally and emotionally this will bring you back to your center in a very subtle way. Which is why this is a great tool for meditation and grounding. Your kidneys and liver will be happy.",B01G7QSHNM,AGG3247AO3JDKORTZXOBXF5EIOKQ,2015-10-01 15:24:59.000

4,"Does not work, not accurate at all","Firstly, this was the most vitamin E I could get for the best price. Most others at this price point had less than half this amount.<br /><br />Secondly, this stuff works great. I've been mixing it with a little bit of vitamin C oil and putting it on my face every day and it's definitely improved the way my skin looks and feels. I ran into a friend the other day and she asked if I was wearing makeup and said it looked really good. I told her I wasn't wearing any - I'd just been trying out a new product on my face. This is the only thing that's changed in my skincare routine, so I believe it is the cause of my improved skin.",B06XXW2FKQ,AG2ZI4INS6VZIYZNOAGEWAWBWLYQ,2018-04-08 20:07:30.508

4,Good stuff!,"Even though I dislike paying a lot for supplements, after reading the description and comparing with other C vitamins available, I decided that this brand with 500 mg Vitamin C along with bioflavonoids would be the best choice. I am taking it to help a gut enzyme that breaks down histamine contained in food. Having read that 1000 mg would be the maximum I should take, I decided on the 500 mg daily dose.

4,Recommended by our Pediatric NP. Great Value!,This product works well. I like how quickly it reads the temperature. Our old under arm thermometer would take at least 30-45 seconds and holding a sick young child still while it took the temp was a hassle. This one is much quicker and reads accurately and consistently the first time. It comes in a hard plastic case to protect it and is small and easy to travel with wherever you go.,B00454A1HE,AGPGUSL2MNHZXX2GI2GPOZ4PVP7Q,2021-09-12 23:50:37.777

4,the absorption rate is great,"UPDATE:  I love this product!  I'm canceling my subscription and buying direct however because the last few deliveries were either damaged or spoiled.<br /><br />I'm about to purchase my third bottle.  At first I was really put off by the smell, I thought I had a bad batch it was so bad.  But I manned-up and tried it and here's what I learned:<br /><br />1.  It smells bad, tastes good (after you get used to it), and makes me feel like a million bucks.<br />2.  Shake that bottle like it's full of money!  This potion is potent and the content settles, so shake it well before opening and a little every time you pick it up thereafter and it becomes much more pleasant.<br />3.  Take it religiously for best results and to ensure you use it all during the shelf life which is not determined (but everything goes bad eventually).  I take a half ounce in a measuring shot glass at breakfast and again at dinner with never a problem.  It does mix well with shakes and fruity drinks, use larger portions to disipate the taste.",B07M5X9BWL,AGT27RKPSRWVXPOPRUMY4X4OUWZQ,2016-06-20 17:35:59.000

4,They work,"My ND suggested Thorne’s SF722 to treat Candida in my gut. We titrated up slowly but I started feeling a difference even at 2-3 caps, 3x a day (morning, midday, and night). Interestingly, by the time I reached 5 caps, 3x a day, I noticed that the deep itch in my right ear canal was ebbing. Within a few weeks, I noticed that my right ear wasn’t overproducing wax. I’ve struggled with both for more than a decade. I also had four colonics, during which the therapist noted Candida being expelled. I’m at three months and feeling better than I have in 10+ years. I feel renewed and optimistic.",B00Q71ERRS,AG63ODVHZA4TQ3CORQLQN7KOGRIQ,2015-09-18 15:26:07.000

3,It was a great scale but obviously not for us,It does give you an energy boost which lasts for a few hours. However if you have high blood pressure do not use this. The next few days you can get a upward spike in blood pressure which makes these unsafe. I showed these to my doctor who told me not to use them. It's not worth the health risk.,B002VLZ8C6,AGG7X7WPXC3TXH6AIOCOKD2V2NNQ,2017-12-31 14:10:15.863
4,Good Experience,"I was looking for a magnesium supplement that was easily absorbed but without the laxative effects that other forms can cause. I've tried magnesium citrate in the past and while it doesn't bother me, other family members have had a different experience.<br /><br />Magnesium glycinate is supposed to be much less likely to cause digestive issues than citrate. BulkSupplements had a good price on the bulk powder so I thought I'd order some and see for myself. The good news is that we've have no issues at all with it.<br /><br />If you plan to put the powder into gel caps, note that it isn't very dense which makes it harder to pack. In fact, after making a month's worth of caps, I've decided that the raw powder doesn't taste too bad after all.<br /><br />This product is definitely worth a try if you need a good magnesium supplement without the laxative effects of magnesium citrate.",B00479XXEA,AETRO5MCK7E2Z4YSBZK3F3F6QLLQ,2014-12-30 18:30:50.000

2,Great for condensing several lotions together when down to the bottom bits.,"It seems that every time I'm tested for Vitamin D my blood shows I'm very low on Vitamin D. I've added some outdoor time and I've tried adding Vit. D tablets. My Vit D levels did not go up in the next two blood tests. My doctor has suggested I try to find some fast dissolve vitamin D tablets. He said that this might help my body absorb Vitamin D. We'll see as I don't have another blood test for a while<br /><br />These are plain white with no markings on them. They are very fast to dissolve. I put one on my tongue and a few seconds later there is nothing in my mouth. These have a taste almost like lemons or oranges. It is tart but it isn't sour or terrible tasting.<br /><br />Because they taste good and there are no markings on the pills, I am a bit concerned that my children (or their friends) might get into them and take a lot thinking they are candy or something. I would have preferred to have had a child's lock on the bottle. I simply put them up high and that works for now. But be warned that there is not a children's lock on this bottle.",B00XJU61E2,AE6LIJ3ZWJ2P7BOHWFC744VESDBA,2018-11-23 16:27:02.066

5,I weigh a different amount depending on the room that this scale is in,"I recently purchased this item after researching a natural way of helping my 8 year old calm down. I chose this product because of it's story of creation as well as the reviews I read. We are just 30 days into the use of these pills. He is taking them with the fish oil as is recommended. I'm not sure exactly what my expectation was. I have a child that is very active and has issues with impulse control at times and I have to often say get control. Taking these has now become a part of his every day routine and he'll even say to me - Mom, I need my chill pills. I haven't noticed a huge change in him but I've asked him if he feels that they are helpful and he says yes. We'll likely continue using these for at least 3 months to see what continued difference we see.",B074CRGSF9,AG2LAQECU7EX2DCJ6EWV2ILHHPRA,2020-06-21 03:47:44.941

I still take prescription migraine meds, but before the magnesium supplement I was needing a supplemental prescription med in addition to my daily migraine prescription med.  Since taking daily magnesium I've only taken one of the supplemental pills once when typically I'd use up the monthly prescription and would use more if I had the ability to!  I just haven't been getting them, when for the past three years I've been getting terrible migraines that would last for days.",B07SYNTL34,AFFFTO3EIHJSOC7IVMHBMCRUWWCQ,2017-02-18 12:49:54.000

3,NOT easy to swallow.,"I bought these hoping to clear my shoulder acne scars from the inside out... I used the whole bottle before writing this review. Didn’t miss one day. This didn’t do anything for my skin. I wish it would have but it didn’t. I’m giving it two stars because I’m sure it has potential for someone who has clear skin but wants to keep their skin flawless when that occasional pimple comes up. I don’t know. But unfortunately, it didn’t work for me. Maybe a little more biotin would help?",B07S892926,AGS4PIN4EKPUCWRG5FFDYVU7IC7Q,2021-08-30 18:56:32.671

My total iron and ferritin are low, despite high hemoglobin, so I'm wondering if this is the reason.  I decided to make the switch as I heard glycinate is very bioavailable and is good for sleep.  So far so good.  I have had NO night time issues since starting it.  I just mix with my flavored water and chug it down.",B01IHLB6OW,AEMN2LEE4ZZQZWZLWPJRQVO63DAA,2022-04-17 21:08:24.165

High doses of Vitamin A, for no more than 3 days in a row, stops viruses from replicating, thus, killing the virus that makes you sick. This micellized Vit A is easy to take, and tastes great. My hubby got very sick with a virus one night, and stayed home from work the following day. I got him to take 2 doses of Vit A, Plus some elderberry syrup.

5,Not trustful,What is i26 hyperimmune egg powder?<br />Hyperimmune egg is an egg from a hen that has been vaccinated against certain infectious diseases.

I was impressed with the K2 flavor, and wanted to wait before rating the D3 Liquid drops just to be sure...<br /><br />Well, I'm sure!<br />The D3 Liquid drops by this brand tastes great. In fact it has very little taste and if you drip it directly onto your tongue, you have to take note and focus so you can feel them hit your tongue since the taste is so slight.<br /><br />I do like the drops versus the pills, as I just detest taking pills every day, and this brand makes it so I don't mind taking it every day.<br /><br />So, a solid 5 Star on the D3 Liquid drops, just like the K2 drops I have.",B06XXGX8PD,AGQ3VQDQCN54LDWAPTHNPJ5EWRZA,2017-08-25 02:57:32.475

They DO NOT PEEL EVER once using this enough. My ex-husband was so horribly burned he had blisters and was sick. I applied this to the burned portions repeatedly, even after the red was gone for about a week. He never peeled. The only spots that did crust up were where the blisters were.

The next was very helpful with just 2 vitamins.

I even felt like exercising, and did a little.

I received it yesterday and aside from the fact that it only came with 2 of the 4 included batteries-- no biggie, just had to use our own brand new ones-- this scale weighed everyone in our family OVER 60 lbs more than our normal weight!. We did have some fun seeing how &#34;fat&#34; we were, but it serves no reliable purpose to have around when you're trying to keep track of your actual weight. There is no way to calibrate it, so I need to return it to Amazon. Waste of money-- other that the fact that it's sleek and pretty, it serves no purpose!!!",B017DT4HM2,AG57PAWJ53IIYFINI4ZEK6Y46YPA,2014-09-25 16:27:38.000

5,Not for me.,I got this for my 7 year old and she loves it. She wanted a watch with a step counter and she appreciates the dual band colors and long battery life (normally 3 days). She has asked for a timer which is not available on this watch. The straps go on pretty snugly and she broke one side of the watch that holds the strap. I contacted customer support and they very quickly offered to send us a brand new one. 5 stars for incredible customer support and honoring their 12-month warranty!,B00F7OZJQ4,AFSS4UHHV5OE2PI5DNXJOMUD6NGQ,2014-08-14 04:54:58.000

1,Too Sweet,"I am a male in my late 50's and am it really good shape overall (again - for my age) and hate taking a fist full of vitamins and having them come back to haunt me later without really believing in their efficacy. This is different. I do not get the burpee stuff going on and feel like I want to puke midway through a workout. I truly do feel that I am getting far more value out of this than the typical ""multivitamin pill"". I especially like it that I feel the B1, B12 and B6 ""working"" if you will, but but do not feel jittery or like I am crashing a few hours later (I would not recommend taking though before you go to bed). I have tried other liquid vitamins and I really have to say that this is the best I have found - for my needs anyway.",B07SYNTL34,AE6VSAHS3DXR5PDQMQHHUX4YK5FA,2017-06-18 16:04:22.699

4,Excellent product,I love my scale so much I bought two! They are so light. I don't keep mine in the bathroom because I don't want my kids playing on it but it is very light to move from room to room. Every morning I move it to the bathroom to weigh myself. I bought one for work as well because I recently started a weight loss program and I have to keep track of my weight. These scales are so sleek looking and easy to use.Love it!,B00O96VOJ2,AESTBUQDULAYCFONMGQHEIGU75RA,2016-01-03 18:37:40.000

3,as advertised,This product is helping me to release excess yeast and so far seems very potent. A lot of customers are leaving poor reviews saying the expiration date is from 2019 but that is actually the date it was manufactured (MFG) so the sticker expiration date is correct. I contacted Thorne directly to ask about whether or not to take with food. They said at first it's best taken with some food such as crackers (Not exactly on the candida diet but whatevs) in the beginning until your body adjusts to the supplement. You don't necessarily have to take it with a meal but that may be a good approach when introducing the undecylenic acid.

Vibrations are strong and she always feels it go off and it doesnt bother other kids while she's at school.  Its very easy to use.. You don't need a cable to charge it, just unsnap the bracelet and plug into a usb slot.  Comes with 2 bands, so she can mix and match which is great for a little fashionista.  The app is responsive and user friendly.  Love this watch!",B01IAIF3GE,AEEU6LFM33WVJX3WNLKBHPY7DMHQ,2018-03-23 04:49:10.502

3,"These are gross, huge, chewables.  Choke down the capsules, they aren’t too big.","Without the app - the scale works very well.  Pop the included 4x AAA batteries into the back of the unit and stand on it.  You'll only get the weight reading this way though<br /><br />With the app - it still works well but may need to step on/off the scale to get it to record sometimes.  Keep in mind you're downloading the EUFY Life app which is a dashboard for other EUFY products and the scale data is housed within this app (my gf had to get a copy of the app on her own phone to track her own set of data - not a problem for me but as another reviewer mentioned it was a point of contention for them).  The Bluetooth synching is quick, but as mentioned above sometimes you step onto the scale and the app will think and think but nothing will happen.  Just stepping off and on should does the trick, slight inconvenience and not consistent.  I'm not a huge health nut or anything like that so the information provided is clean and simple and provides some simple insights against what I believe is probably national averages.  The history chart is also a nice touch.  Everything in this package is simple and suits my casual needs<br /><br />On a side note - I can't speak to the health &#34;accuracy&#34; but I did find that the first measurement seemed to be a bit high, after re-measuring each day over the weekend the numbers seem to have stabilized.

There was a dog hair on the Velcro when I opened it and also the box it came from seemed used.<br />2. The instructions are written in VERY broken English.

2,One Star,"I took these supplements for a month (there's a 30 day supply). These, unfortunately, weren't for me. They made me nauseous and the fish oil left me a bit rank smelling everytime I took it (I tested this by not taking the fish oil for 2 days, but continued to take the others supplements in the packet and discovered it was the fish oil). These supplements did nothing for me health wise. I'd say buy something more effective and pure in ingredients.",B07448G44N,AE2GQBFMXIEX6KWKLBVGT5GXHJHA,2023-01-03 05:32:02.018

4,Vitamin B12 Methylcobalamin is a Great Choice!,"I have tried mixing this into coffee and that is absolutely not the move for me. The taste is one that needs to be acquired, but I’ve found that mixing it with chocolate ensure and goats milk makes it palatable for me.

5,GREEN SOURCE IS AVAILABLE AT AMAZON!!!!!,I usually purchase the Nordic omega 3 gummys that come in the box. I purchased these and they're 5 times the size of the other gummies and have less mgs of omega 3 making it 100 times harder to get my kid to eat then. Idk what I was thinking when I ordered these.

5,Five Stars,"The tracker is okay. Battery only lasts about 48 hours if you want to use several of the options available, which is the reason for ordering it. The app is HORRIBLE!!! The text alerts do show the message but the vibration to tell you of the message is very very faint making it useless. The only real way you know you have a text is if you happen to see the screen light up & the msg only shows once. The tracker also randomly turns off for no apparent reason. It did come back on but I don't what actually worked to get it back on....",B07SYNTL34,AEAR4AW75AVXQZ6FIWS6GQ5LZOLA,2018-04-04 03:39:29.062

3,Amazing stuff,I bought this for my lipgloss making for my company. It works very well but you do have to use a lot to make your lipgloss the consistency you want it to be.

Thankfully, so far in 4 days of the Collagen product by LIV It's been receptive to my body, very refreshing, easy to mix and go! I tried the Strawberry Margarita and the taste isn't too strong, you can drink it at any point during your day. Its almost like adding fresh fruit to your water.

2,Great nutrition horrible taste,"I got my Bio-Rebalance in the evening and wanted to wait until the next morning to start it. It says to take a scoop in the morning and a scoop at night. I took a half scoop first just to see how it felt. 60 minutes later I was calmer, happier, more focused and motivated, and that feeling lasted all day. I didn't even take the night dose. It tasted great especially considering all the nutrients combined in it. I've tried other powdered combo supplements and they're all mixed with artificial colors and flavors, which I hate the taste and also the nasty unhealthy chemicals in my body. Bio-Rebalance did not disappoint. 5-Stars from me!",B06XXW2FKQ,AET5RGGVMXP3Z2AX3WE6R3ZFA2GA,2018-04-13 19:33:13.725

4,Broke After Two Uses,"I’ve been a mom for almost 36 years. In that time, I’ve owned and used A LOT of thermometers.  This is one of the best I’ve ever used. Want to know why? For one thing, the tip at the end is flexible. When using it on myself, I found this to be WONDERFUL! I have a VERY SERIOUS gag reflex. Most thermometers make me gag because when they’re up under my tongue they just always seem to push that special button that makes me…uck. BUT, with this one, I was able to bend it just a little—keeping it up under my tongue—but it pushed down instead of back and…tada!...no gagging. LOVE THAT. Another thing that just amazed me was how accurate it seemed to be. The first day I got it, I took my temperature 10 times throughout the day. Mind you, I was not sick. Just testing it out. It read between 98.3 and 98.8 all day; pretty steady. THEN, a few days later, my husband got sick. He had a high temp. We took a reading at 11:00 pm that read 102.3. The next day we took him to the doctor. HER thermometer read 102.1. If it’s reading the same as the doctor’s, I would take that to mean it’s accurate. One last thing and then I’ll stop gushing. I LOVE the little happy/not happy faces on the read out. CUTE. But, practical too. My grandson is 8. He looked at the thermometer after taking a daytime temp for my husband and said, “Grammy, there’s a sad face. That means Papaw is really sick!” LOVE IT!",B07LBMQR5T,AFMINMSA7VNUFCHPDA5HYZ2APZZA,2017-02-15 13:23:41.000
2,good for weight gain,"I sent a message before on this. It does not weigh 400 pounds as advertised. It doesn't feel safe to me, stepping on glass. However, I did receive a refund of a partial cost of the scales and kept them.",B01A90FMHQ,AHRLSO3PZ5VRBQUK7RH75TRZLHCA,2018-03-17 15:12:17.461

3,Great probiotic,"This is a great product ! My Natural Doctor told me about this and I use it the first hint of a UTI and those symptoms just go away. I also take with a couple of cranberry capsules.  This washes the bacteria out of your bladder where it doesn't belong, bacteria is in your stomach and that's OK but sometimes it makes it's way to the bladder. D-Mannose is a type of sugar that attaches to the bacteria and washes it out.",B015QLFIXQ,AGID2L6OAWIZDJGOYZSNHKDGG4RA,2016-08-06 22:19:15.000

3,A nice alternative to pills!!,Seems very accurate.  Used it to weigh suitcase for check-in purposes and scale displayed weight just under 50 lbs which was the limit before additional charge - no problem when weighed on check-in at the airport.  Easier to use compared to my old scale which required a tap to turn it on and zero before stepping on it for weight  measurement.  This one is zeroed before it even goes on.  It goes to zero when you step off and reads the same weight each consecutive time that you step on it.  Awesome buy!,B017DT4HM2,AH6GTEKJMBNXZKJ7PVM376F2GMTQ,2020-01-12 03:19:14.501

3,#1 recommended,"Update:<br />After my first scale did not work properly the company and its reps reached out and we found a solution. Although the original malfunctioned they made every effort to make it right going above and beyond.<br /><br />Didn’t work properly. Weight was different every time you stepped on the scale and I mean every time. Seconds after you weighed yourself it would read 5 lbs heavier, 3 lbs lighter and so on and so forth. Utterly useless.

4,Love it!!,If you truly want to know your temperature get an old fashioned mercury type.<br /> Unless you are willing to pay the price for a hospital quality digital thermometer.<br />Anything less is untrustworthy and inaccurate. This model was off by 2 degrees.<br /> There is a big difference between 98.6 and 100.6 .,B00DG8TEFK,AGNKYFQDOQEGWY2EKTTPXWIXZVZA,2020-11-11 01:52:34.753

4,Delicious,"Excellent cholinergic supplement, I felt it working almost instantly and the effect was amplified with the addition of alcar. I wasn't expecting much but the changes were drastic.<br /><br />The effects are quite surprising and profound including: improvement in recall, improvement in vocalization, total remission of &#34;brain fog&#34;, decreased anxiety and more overall mental energy.<br /><br />Not only does centrophenoxine function as a choline precursor but it also has the novel ability of enhancing choline uptake. Those of us who suffer from anxiety, depression, racing thoughts or dementia could benefit greatly from supplementation with this product.<br /><br />Powder city as always has great prices and very fast shipping (took 2 days with non-prime shipping)",B07L81VZH9,AE3GQUMVRYQZ2NNKC3RWOE2XYSFA,2020-01-23 23:48:25.033
4,yuck,"I’ve been using this for over 20 years! Stores stopped selling it and I was finally able to find it on Amazon. This is a perfect moisturizer in humid climates and for active people. Lotion blocks your pores and when you sweat, it feels disgusting, but this is absorbed completely and doesn’t feel like you have anything on. It basically hydrates your skin.<br />It’s also great for sunburn, if applied 2-3 times a day, your sunburn will turn into a tan WITHOUT SKIN PEELING!  Proven true by southerners like me and many friends and family.<br />The best benefit for this product-  it reduces and PREVENTS wrinkles, stretch marks, and skin crepe (“old lady skin”).  This is the only product I have used for over 20 years and I am constantly fooling people on my age. It’s frozen my age by 15 years!<br />If you’re older, get it now and stop skin aging! Hydrate your skin to reduce wrinkles.<br />If you’re younger, start using it now!!  I apply it head to toe every day after I shower.<br />This is the best product I have ever bought and only the 2nd product review I have ever done.",B003U3658U,AE4UNG6RE7ULNX7MBU3CQ72BDFWQ,2021-09-21 16:01:30.074

3,Good stuff,"Gotta be the best multivit on the planet.  Have learned that one big direction I can take buying an MVI is to get a whole foods one.  Sure makes my body feel better; last longer every day.  The next, if you can afford it, is to get a whole food MVI that also has a concentrate of superfoods.  This outshines all the times I took both an MVI and a multimineral compound.  So, for a totally subjective, anecdotal recommendation,here ya go: 5 out of 5!",B00454A1HE,AHKIAL7XKTV5ZWFWENTM2FIGYPVQ,2018-03-21 18:24:21.947

2,"Was great, until it quit",I've had constipation for 15 years. This product probably works best for only occasional constipation. Gave five stars because usually these products are not recommended anyway for people with severe constipation.and it worked extremely well the very first time I took it.,B00XJU61E2,AECQW2ZOFLMKNJBCLAVLF3XY6WYA,2014-10-10 11:12:53.000
2,A Super Thin Winner!!,"I have no baseline from which to judge these vitamins.  I feel no better or worse for taking them and question if they're worth the $60 price tag.  The taste is rough, so much so that my wife refuses to take them.  My urine 'glows in the dark' so that tells me most of the vitamins are just passing through my systems, unused, which means money wasted.  I have reduced my usage to three days a week because of this.<br />My wife and I are healthy people, eat a carnivore diet and take minor supplements.  I thought this might be good to introduce - even though it's not in the carnivore lifestyle -  but I just don't know.<br />I guess they're okay.  No reason to ding them too much except for the god-awful taste.  I can't see buying them again.",B01AG1NO8C,AEPIHGTYDDQS7ALHN5IVEFKCIDRQ,2019-04-18 08:14:23.292

3,Five Stars,"I've been using SFH Fuel for a couple years now and I love the coconut flavor. It works great as a stand-alone protein powder (to mix in with water after a workout) or as a supplement to things like smoothies. I will often throw a scoop in my breakfast green smoothies to add some protein and a touch of sweetness and flavor.  It mixes well into the smoothies. For stand-alone protein with water, make sure you use a blender bottle or something else to help really mix it up. It doesn't lump as bad as some protein powders I've used but does require a decent shake in order to break up the lumps. Love this stuff!",B06XHCS137,AHWZZY3A5V2YNKPFRW4BPQQHJW2Q,2021-11-03 14:17:10.969

4,Great quality,"This is the best facial product I've ever used, and I've tried them all even ones that are 100+ $. This can be used all over the body with no greasiness or build up , and does not clog the pores. It moisturizers and firms my face better than anything. I have kept trying others but kept going back to this and this is the one I'll stick with. I also gave it to my masseuse to use on me during massages the cream she used made me so hot all day and stuck to my cloths. This product is great even in the summer months when other creams make me feel like I'm suffocating . I love this product. My only proble is it has gotten hard to find in stores. I can only find it on line. For that reason I stock up when I can. I have 12 bottles in my bathroom closet right now.

The first two bottles I ordered were great, but then the third bottle I ordered was all dried out. The tablets had little dark spots all over them and they were hard as a rock. I returned them. I figured it was a fluke, so later I ordered two more bottles which just came today, and BOTH bottles are super old just like the first one! I flipped them over and saw they expire in 3 months, so I'm guessing they're just keeping these bottles around for too long possibly in a hot place.

4,Five Stars,This product is terrible. I would like to give it negative stars. I have only owned it for about two weeks and am extremely disappointed.

The micro Daily tablets helped me with 10 years of chronic lower back pain.  The reduction in this pain helped with my stomach inflammation. Now, I never expected this result from something labeled as a vitamin product...and I realize that this seems rather hard to believe, however, I am both pleased and surprised with the results.  There is far more going on with micro vitamins than just a traditional mix of vitamins A, B ,and C.  Great product.",B002VLZ8C6,AFXTH4HEI4O3I3SK7FL3B6XO7EQQ,2020-01-04 20:19:56.823

4,Worth the splurge...,"This was our first time trying a liquid vitamin and unfortunately it did not go well. We got it for our teenage son and he was not a fan of the taste but also told me that it made him feel a little weird. So I tried it myself and almost immediately had an allergic reaction that I needed to take OTC medication to control. The only stuff that I am really allergic to in life is poison ivy/oak and so this reaction really surprised me. I don't know if we just got a bad batch or there is something in the formula that doesn't agree with us.

This particular product is the cheapest and the least amount of pills you have to take a day to reach a good dose (2 a day for me). I pair this with Onnit Alpha Brain and see a HUGE increase in performance, memory, and ability to recover from daily demands, as well as lasting longer where my brain has to stay engaged.

5,Everyone should use this.,"Nice look and it is consistent between readings.  Large numbers that are easy to read with an attractive blue back light.  Unlike other scales, this one displays the weight immediately so you can see it rising, falling, and fluctuating with movement.  Once it locks on the weight it flashes and stops adjusting.  I like this feature because you can see what the scale is doing immediately.  Other scales will return an error when they can't lock on an exact weight if the person can't/won't stand still.  With this one you'll at least be able to see the range it is fluctuating within.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone.",B07T9F1ZS5,AGL3ELVVD5RMW4DPTEOATUI4QDDQ,2017-09-07 19:11:46.498

4,great product and company,"This Somaluxe stretch mark treatment cream comes in a bottle with a safety sealed top.  The cream is white and appears to be whipped.  There is a definite scent to the cream which is a lot like unscented cocoa butter.  There is a long list of organic oils and vitamins that have gone into this formula that are very impressive.<br /><br />I bought this for stretch marks that have appeared on legs and arms due to weight loss.  They’re very bothersome and cause sensitivity when anyone makes remarks about them, so I thought this would be great to see if it really does help reduce the appearance of stretch marks.  What I’ve done is taken pictures of the offending marks “before” using this cream, and will be taking pictures in 30 to 60 days of “after” to see if I can tell a difference.<br /><br />I will come back on here sometime between 30 to 60 days and post the progress that is seen with the use of this product.  Now, so far, I like the ingredients listed.  I like the whipped consistency that the treatment cream has, and the smell, although unusual, is a thumbs up because it’s almost a neutral odor, that’s good in that you can wear it and it doesn’t clash with any other scent you may have on.<br /><br />As I put some of it on one of my stretch marks, I noticed that it filled in the thin lines of the stretched skin, and that there was no oiliness or stickiness to it.  It kind of soaks into the stretch mark and stays where it’s put.  I will update this review information over the next few months when I can see how well this treatment does in its claims to healing existing stretch marks and preventing future ones.<br /><br />Disclosure:  I bought this product with a promotional discount (or was given the product for free) in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.  And, hey, I look at reviews before I buy something too, to make sure it’s a product that would serve my family in some positive way.  I love to share my insight and opinion about the things I buy and I do so with Benjamin Franklin’s quote always in mind:  Honesty is the best policy.",B01A90FMHQ,AGVOIDWKHO2SSR2OWBZA7E3ZOREA,2018-02-13 18:17:45.040

2,Good Scale,"I have been taking these on and off for years and I recently started back on them. I like the Vitamin Shoppe brand with no iron because they have all my vitamin needs, plus minerals and fruits and vegetables that a woman could need. I've taken vitamins from other brands and just don't get the same feeling. As soon as start taking these, my acne starts clearing up, my skin feels softer and I just feel better. I can't really put my finger on it. I have to get the NO IRON one as the one with iron gives horrible bowel issues. I take a separate gentle iron supplement that helps that. These pills are big and you take two, but they are coated so the slide down easily with liquid. I always take them with a full meal as I will get nauseous from any vitamin if I don't. Also, they make my urine a very bright almost fluorescent yellow. So don't be alarmed. Just the body's way of getting rid of anything the body doesn't use in the vitamins. I love these. Please never stop making these! My honest opinion.",B01MRHCA09,AG6H2FE63SS6P7MOSK4ZWUQ7FKZQ,2015-12-08 16:54:56.000

3,My daugther love the flavor.,It is so hard to find a good quality thermometer. This one seems to fit the bill. It beeps to let you know when it is finished checking so you don't have to guess or try to read the display if you can't see it.

4,This is the best product I have ever used on dry skin and ...,"I love these energy herbs. They have been effective for me in so many cases; particularly, at work and late nights as a college student. Usually, just one or two tablets is all I use at one time and I have never experienced harmful side effects. I wish other supplements were as fast acting as this supplement, because it's wonderful to see results immediately.",B07MZMDMRM,AHDGKUJKGCCNTZLKVM5QS5G5GNWA,2019-10-10 09:23:39.491

2,WARNING BEFORE USE!,"They taste really good and I LOVE the smell. I actually kept opening it when I first got it just to get more of the strawberry smell!

5,Economical Heart Aid....Hawthorn Berry tablets from Best Naturals,"Easy to swallow (since it is a liquid, not a pill).

5,Tastes good!,"Many years ago I found a vitamin E gel at the dollar store.  Of course, that meant it wasn't going to be there forever because it was discontinued merchandise.  I stocked up on it and it helped soothe the dried-out patches of skin that were home to plaque psoriasis.  Once I ran out, I found a vitamin E cream which was an acceptable substitute aside from taking much longer to soak into my skin.<br /><br />Recently I discovered this product.  I have already used this manufacturer's aloe vera gel for decades so I tried it.  It's soothing but the aloe in it can sting briefly.  (I'm used to that from using pure aloe gel, so it doesn't bother me very much.)<br /><br />This is a good price for three bottles of this size.  I especially appreciate that they were shrink-wrapped together which prevented the caps from coming open in transit.",B07WHZ9JT4,AHX5D2FBE6O3YFMMPFTDREYTD2QQ,2020-03-03 19:06:58.368
5,Awesome Value. Better Than Original.,I had surgery and both of my doctors recommended this for healing and scaring.  Unbelievable results.  My doctor recommended this product.

4,JUNK WORST THAN CHINESE,Update: Eufy updated the app so users can connect multiple accounts to the scale. Some of the UX in the app is still clunky but it's tolerable. There is a menu with a lot of options/settings accessed by tapping your small profile picture and there is no indication that even a useful button that can be pressed. I take all the information besides the weight with a grain of salt. The amount of information gleaned from the bottom of your feet seems too good to be true and I have no way to verify it's accuracy.<br /><br />The scale seems to work but can only connect with one account which wouldn't be a problem if more than one person with a phone wants to use it. The user interface in the app is terrible. You're supposed to be able to add multiple users to the only account that the scale can connect to but if there is a way to do it 2 people working together couldn't figure it out. Overall a very disappointing and frustrating experience. Luckily I haven't thrown away the packaging because I'm seriously considering returning the product. I'm giving it 2 stars because at least it worked for one person.<br /><br />I figured out how to add users. Still 2 stars.,B00TDFGU5M,AG2QN3GWKRJWU5ZAG55BIEJBAP7A,2017-01-18 19:01:42.000
3,Works well,"This is an excellent product!I have been using it for 2 months and the results are obvious.I feel better,more energy,and more focus.This is a liquid that your body absorbs more than a tablet.Tastes pretty good,no after taste.Read the ingredients,it has so much of what your body needs!I highly recommend!",B008PPXD9M,AHHQFHDEDL5W4RE56B35RO4JPZHA,2019-07-22 19:05:33.570

5,I also received an email from customer support with some FAQs- a nice touch and not something I generally receive with things ..,Looked everywhere for halal gummies and I finally found the one.The only prenatal gummy that doesn’t make my stomach hurt! The taste is not bad at all to be honest the consistency of it makes it easy to go down. I also have been feeling much more energized and just love the fact that it’s organic and feels good in my body. I will always be buying these gummies and recommend them to anyone especially those who need kosher or halal. Two thumbs up!!,B0096U3VD8,AHV2JFXOM6PAWJJNFH7YNQW3HDUQ,2018-02-13 00:32:31.742
4,Read the ingredients - It's all in there. Compare for yourself.,"Showed up on time - that’s about it. Unfortunately I didn’t test it when I received it, now it’s too late to return it.

5,Four Stars,"I never really stuck to the entire take a tablet one or two times a day thing, I was never consistent in taking this, yet I still noticed a huge difference in the fullness of my hair. My barber noticed a lot too, which genuinely surprised her. When I told her what I was taking she started recommended it to her other clients and so far there has been more positive feedback from it. For myself, I didn't noticed any immediate results, even a couple weeks in. You never notice the small changes over time, so it was the combination of my barber asking me why my hair is thicker, and seeing then seeing my head from a rear view on a security camera one day. It was pretty nice seeing the results, and I'm sold on using this product now!",B000FGXMWC,AGFQDBWLGPJOPJJYNUUOGIDG5PZA,2020-04-11 15:30:37.762

I will purchase this brand again. I tried other brands of boron because I heard it was a good replacement for HRT, which I discontinued. After a lot of research, I decided to try it.

I never dropped 10 pounds in 3 days in my life...I have had this scale now since jan... it has been messing up... it gives off different weights measure and you cant believe it any more... maybe if it wasn't ran by batteries... maybe it would be alright..will not buy another one of these... waste of money and time...,B07NF5ZGS2,AGV6R42VMZORJBL67VDASJ25HAQQ,2021-06-22 01:00:53.844
4,Good,"Review update: I've been taking these for a couple weeks now and they just get worse and worse. I now cant even take it without gagging. they leave a awful fishy smell on my hands and coat my mouth with fish oil. I will not be purchasing these again<br />I have not tried these yet as I've just recieved them and still have 2 days left of my previous prenatals.  Upon opening then I was hit with this terrible fishy smell, just awful and they made my hands smell just putting them into my pill sorter. The only reason I stopped using my other prenatals is because I've just had my baby and am only taking them because I'm nursing so there is no need to spend $30 per month on prenatals. I will update my review in a few days once I start them but I can tell already that I will be having some horrid smelly burps in my near future 🥴",B010RS2YNA,AHRB7EDHQJ4WOD2HZ2RO2O6FK67A,2019-11-21 10:35:08.573

I take two tablets daily and have seen no drop in it's benefits (as compared to the actual leaves). I really feel it's helped it's helped me GREATLY with my ability to find personal calmness. I'm not talking some miracle pill....but regular use has certainly helped me.,B078SBDGGB,AGTVVL37TQ6SLOB46EEO5BWO6SDQ,2012-12-20 17:59:55

2,"My kids both love these, so no problems getting them to take additional vitamin D3 for winter","I bought this for someone else. She said that it, along with diet has helped to regulate her moderately high BP, better than just diet alone. She'll have me order again.",B01LZMCHX6,AHMOPYAM55VQXFVR5AN3K2VCMKKA,2015-10-22 03:09:56.000

4,Good for what I need them,Band is a perfect match replacement. Hopefully I will get longer than three years out of it. That is how long the original one lasted. My only complaint is the large is way too big. Shipping process was quick smooth and easy with no complications.,B005CD3ADO,AFLFUO46SSMH4E67NIXLG4LJN4OQ,2015-06-08 04:31:20.000

5,Stuck with GOOFY watch bands  I don't need.,"I use this to remove my eye make up. I purchased reusable fabric discs here on Amazon, and saturate them with just a little bit of this oil. It removes mascara quickly and moisturizes as well. I am highly allergic to many cosmetics so using this natural alternative is healthier and cost effective. You can also use it to condition your hair.",B07SYNTL34,AGZAQ2Z6O6TYHRGEVL3PZPVPSZ2A,2018-09-11 09:26:37.284
4,Five Stars,"Excellent product. I searched all over for a liquid B12 without nasty additives and in an appropriate dose for a toddler to no avail. Also, though it seems to me there is no substantial evidence to suggest the cyano-B12 is inferior to methyl-B12 in terms of B12 levels in the body, I opted to go with the methyl version simply because there is no controversy surrounding its safety and effectiveness. Anyway, for dosing, I've improvised with this product and my toddler loves it. She gets a single drop 2-3x/week which is still more than she needs, but not a super mega dose that everything else had. This product had the best ingredient list, in my opinion. I have also used it a couple times and it is very pleasant tasting.",B071GRF7TG,AG7E6JJWPF5JNFUR4QREFJQAHFCQ,2017-03-02 03:15:42.000

4,I highly recommend Multi-V I've been taking it for almost a year ...,"My doctor prescribed these vitamin tablets in a bottle of just 50 tablets. When I'd used all of them, I reordered, but this time from Amazon and in a bottle of 1,000 tablets. I ended up paying much, much less per tablet!",B00VWID4YS,AHY2YQHDIYGAKYTOWTD2YICEDTUQ,2020-01-03 17:42:15.153

2,Five Stars,I was really excited about trying these vitamins since they are supposed to be halal. However they didn't work at all for me. As a matter of fact my nails started breaking off and skin broke out. Maybe there are ingredients that didn't agree with my body. But I've switched and all is well.,B00RU8MEUO,AEYALFP3QV6HWDH5ZCEUW4LXEL2A,2019-05-27 11:51:29.783

4,"*Confusing listing, double check what you're ordering!*","I use this oil for taking my makeup off as it is better than baby oil which is a petroleum product and not the best for skin or eyelashes!  I use this for many things!  Fascia blasting, massage, etc.  It has a silky feel to it also!",B012CTUT9I,AE3RR5AE4OFPL5766J5GVZ6LLLMQ,2019-08-12 04:25:21.231

3,Excellent support for identified symptoms.,"HANDS DOWN THE BEST RESULTS! ive tried similar products but this one has the best results. Consistency is key, ive been taking it for 6 months. My small bald patch up front in my hairline has new growth and that growth is now 5 inches in length. My nails are gowing fast, thick and healthy. They used to be super thin, brittle, peeling and took forever to get any length.  Ive re-ordered this 2x already.",B01A90FMHQ,AFVI7ORETGHQ4S33S6YHH6FY36BA,2018-11-08 02:19:45.580
